<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>A PROMISING OFFICER</h3>
</div>

<p>The lengthening shadows lay blue and cool beneath
the alders by the waterside, though the
cornfields that rolled back up the hill glowed a coppery
yellow in the light of the setting sun. It was hot and,
for the most part, strangely quiet in the bottom of
the valley since the hammers had stopped, but now
and then an order was followed by a tramp of feet
and the rattle of chain-tackle. Along one bank of
the river the reflections of the trees quivered in dark-green
masses; the rest of the water was dazzlingly
bright.
</p>
<p>A pontoon bridge, dotted with figures in khaki,
crossed a deep pool. At its head, where a white road
ran down the hill, a detachment of engineers lounged
in the shade. Their faces were grimed with sweat
and dust, and some, with coats unbuttoned, sprawled
in the grass. They had toiled hard through the heat
of the day, and now were enjoying an &#8220;easy,&#8221; until
they should be called to attention when their work
was put to the test.
</p>
<p>As Lieutenant Richard Brandon stood where the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
curve was boldest at the middle of the bridge, he
had no misgivings about the result so far as the section
for which he was responsible was concerned. He was
young, but there was some ground for his confidence;
for he not only had studied all that text-books could
teach him but he had the constructor&#8217;s eye, which sees
half-instinctively where strength or weakness lies.
Brandon began his military career as a prize cadet
and after getting his commission he was quickly promoted
from subaltern rank. His advancement, however,
caused no jealousy, for Dick Brandon was liked.
He was, perhaps, a trifle priggish about his work&mdash;cock-sure,
his comrades called it&mdash;but about other
matters he was naïvely ingenuous. Indeed, acquaintances
who knew him only when he was off duty thought
him something of a boy.
</p>
<p>In person, he was tall and strongly made, with a
frank, sunburned face. His jaw was square and
when he was thoughtful his lips set firmly; his light-gray
eyes were clear and steady. He was genial with
his comrades, but usually diffident in the company of
women and older men.
</p>
<p>Presently the Adjutant came up and, stopping near,
glanced along the rippling line that marked the curve
of the bridge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;These center pontoons look rather prominent, as
if they&#8217;d been pushed upstream a foot or two,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;Was that done by Captain Maitland&#8217;s
order?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; Dick answered with some awkwardness.
&#8220;For one thing, I found they&#8217;d lie steadier out of the
eddy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They do, but I don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s much of an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
advantage. Had you any other reason for modifying
the construction plans?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick felt embarrassed. He gave the Adjutant a
quick glance; but the man&#8217;s face was inscrutable.
Captain Hallam was a disciplinarian where discipline
was needed, but he knew the value of what he called
initiative.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Dick tried to explain, &#8220;if you notice how
the wash of the head-rapid sweeps down the middle of
the pool&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have noticed it,&#8221; said the Adjutant dryly.
&#8220;That&#8217;s why the bridge makes a slight sweep. But
go on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We found a heavy drag on the center that flattened
the curve. Of course, if we could have pushed
it up farther, we&#8217;d have got a stronger form.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s obvious, sir. If we disregard the moorings,
a straight bridge would tend to curve downstream and
open out under a shearing strain. As we get nearer
the arch form it naturally gets stiffer, because the strain
becomes compressive. After making the bridge strong
enough for traffic, the problem is to resist the pressure
of the current.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; the Adjutant agreed with a smile. &#8220;Well,
we&#8217;ll let the pontoons stand. The traditions of the
British Army are changing fast, but while we don&#8217;t
demand the old mechanical obedience, it might be better
not to introduce too marked innovations. Anyhow,
it&#8217;s not desirable that they should, so to speak,
strike a commanding officer in the eye. Some officers
are conservative and don&#8217;t like that kind of thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He moved on and Dick wondered whether he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
said too much. He was apt to forget his rank and
comparative unimportance when technical matters
were discussed. In fact, it was sometimes difficult
not to appear presumptuous; but when one knew that
one was right&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Adjutant met the Colonel, and
they stopped together at the bridge-head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we have made a good job, but the brigade&#8217;s
transport is pretty heavy,&#8221; the Colonel remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m satisfied with the bridge, sir; very creditable
work for beginners. If the other branches of the new
armies are as good&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The men are in earnest. Things, of course, are
changing, and I suppose old-fashioned prejudices must
go overboard. Personally, I liked the type we had
before the war, but we&#8217;ll let that go. Young Brandon
strikes me as particularly keen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keen as mustard,&#8221; the Adjutant agreed. &#8220;In
other ways, perhaps, he&#8217;s more of the kind you have
been used to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I wonder what you mean by that! You&#8217;re
something of what they&#8217;re pleased to call a progressive,
aren&#8217;t you? However, I like the lad. His work is
good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He <i>knows</i>, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said the Colonel, &#8220;I think I understand.
But what about the drawings of the new pontoons?
They must be sent to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re ready. To tell the truth, I showed them
to Brandon and he made a good suggestion about the
rounding of the waterline.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Colonel looked thoughtful.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the idea of a combined pontoon and light
boat that would carry troops is by no means new; but
these are rather an unusual type and if it were known
that we were building them, it might give the enemy
a hint. I suppose you told Brandon the thing&#8217;s to be
kept quiet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I made it plain,&#8221; the Adjutant said, and they
walked on.
</p>
<p>Dick had been sitting on the bridge, but he jumped
up as a rhythmic tramp of feet came down the hillside.
Dust rose among the cornfields and hung in a
white streak along the edge of a wood, and then with
a twinkling flash of steel, small, ocher-colored figures
swung out of the shadow. They came on in loose
fours, in an unending line that wound down the steep
slopes and reached the bridge-head. Then orders
rolled across the stream, the line narrowed, and the
measured tramp changed to a sharp uneven patter.
The leading platoon were breaking step as they crossed
the bridge. Dick frowned impatiently. This was a
needless precaution. The engineers&#8217; work was good;
it would stand the percussive shock of marching feet.
</p>
<p>He stood at attention, with a sparkle in his eyes,
as the hot and dusty men went by. They were, for
the most part, young men, newly raised infantry, now
being hardened and tempered until they were fit to be
used as the army&#8217;s spear-head in some desperate
thrust for which engineers and artillery had cleared
the way. It was some time before the first battalion
crossed, but the long yellow line still ran back up the
hillside to the spot at which it emerged from the deepening
shade, and the next platoon took the bridge with
unbroken step. It swayed and shook with a curious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
regular tremble as the feet came down; but there was
no giving way of tie and stringer-beam, and Dick forgot
the men who were passing, and thought of fastenings
and stressed material.
</p>
<p>He was young and the pomp of war had its effect
on him, but the human element began to take second
place. Although an officer of the new army, he was
first of all an engineer; his business was to handle
wood and iron rather than men. The throb of the
planks and the swing of the pontoons as the load
passed over them fascinated him; and his interest
deepened when the transport began to cross. Sweating,
spume-flecked horses trod the quivering timber
with iron-shod hoofs; grinding wheels jarred the structure
as the wagons passed. He could feel it yield
and bend, but it stood, and Dick was conscious of a
strange, emotional thrill. This, in a sense, was his
triumph; the first big task in which he had taken a
man&#8217;s part; and his work had passed the test. Taste,
inclination, and interest had suddenly deepened into
an absorbing love for his profession.
</p>
<p>After a time, the Adjutant sent for him and held
out a large, sealed envelope.
</p>
<p>&#8220;These are the plans I showed you,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Colonel Farquhar is driving to Newcastle, and will
stop at Storeton Grange for supper at midnight. The
plans must be delivered to him there. You have a
motorcycle, I think?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well; it is not a long ride, but I&#8217;ll release
you from duty now. Don&#8217;t be late at Storeton, take
care of the papers, and get Colonel Farquhar&#8217;s receipt.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></p>
<p>There was a manufacturing town not far off, and
Dick decided to go there and spend the evening with
a cousin of his. They might go to a theater, or if
not, Lance would find some means of amusing him.
As a rule, Dick did not need amusing, but he felt that
he must celebrate the building of the bridge.
</p>
<p>Lance Brandon was becoming known as an architect,
and he had a good deal of constructive talent.
The physical likeness between him and Dick was rather
marked, but he was older and they differed in other
respects. Lance knew how to handle men as well as
material, and perhaps he owed as much to this as to
his artistic skill. His plans for a new church and the
remodeling of some public buildings had gained him
recognition; but he already was popular at country
houses in the neighborhood and was courted by the
leading inhabitants of the town.
</p>
<p>Dick and he dined at the best hotel and Lance
listened sympathetically to the description of the
bridge. He was not robust enough for the army, but
he hinted that he envied Dick; and Dick felt flattered.
He sometimes bantered Lance about his social gifts
and ambitions, but he had never resented the favors
his father had shown his cousin. Lance had been
left an orphan at an early age and the elder Brandon&mdash;a
man of means and standing&mdash;had brought him up
with his son. They had been good friends and Dick
was pleased when his father undertook to give Lance
a fair start at the profession he chose. He imagined
that now Lance was beginning to make his mark, his
allowance had stopped, but this was not his business.
Lance was a very good sort, although he was clever
in ways that Dick was not and indeed rather despised.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What shall we do next?&#8221; Dick asked when they
had lounged for a time in the smoking-room.
</p>
<p>Lance made a gesture of resignation as he stretched
himself in a big chair. He was dressed with quiet
taste, his face was handsome but rather colorless, and
his movements were languid.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re such an energetic beggar,&#8221; he complained.
&#8220;The only theater where they put on plays worth seeing
is closed just now, but there&#8217;s a new dancer at the
nearest hall and we might look in. I hope my churchwarden
patrons won&#8217;t disapprove if they hear of it,
because they talk about building an ornamental mission
room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t find fault with you. Somehow,
nobody does.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some truth in that; the secret is that I
know when to stop. One can enjoy life without making
the pace too hot. People aren&#8217;t really censorious,
and even the narrow-minded sort allow you certain
limits; in fact, I imagine they rather admire you if
you can play with fire and not get singed. Women
do, anyhow; and, in a sense, their judgment&#8217;s logical.
The thing that doesn&#8217;t hurt you can&#8217;t be injurious, and
it shows moderation and self-control if you don&#8217;t pass
the danger line.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know when you have come to the
line?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; smiled Lance, &#8220;experience helps; but I
think it&#8217;s an instinct. Of course, if you do show signs
of damage, you&#8217;re done for, because then the people
who envied you throw the biggest stones.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s start,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;I&#8217;m not much of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
philosopher. Building bridges and digging saps is
good enough for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re healthy occupations, so long as you don&#8217;t
get shot; but, considering everything, it&#8217;s strange that
they still monopolize your interest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick colored. He knew what his cousin meant.
He had been attracted by a girl of whom his father
approved and who was well-bred, pretty, and rich.
Dick imagined that his father&#8217;s views were agreeable
to Helen&#8217;s relatives and that she was not ignorant
of this. Still, nothing had been actually arranged,
and although he admired Helen, it would be time
enough to think of marriage when he was a captain,
for instance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pontoons and excavations have their charm for
men with constructive tastes,&#8221; Lance went on; &#8220;but
you may find later that they don&#8217;t satisfy all your
needs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get your hat!&#8221; Dick returned with a smile, jumping
up as he spoke.
</p>
<p>The music-hall was badly filled. The audience
seemed listless and the performance dragged. Even
the much-praised dancer was disappointing, and there
was an unusual number of shabby loungers in the bar.
Dick had come prepared to enjoy himself after a day
of arduous work, and by way of doing so, he ordered
a drink or two that he did not really want. As a
rule, he was abstemious, but the hall was very hot.
It struck him as glaring and tawdry after the quiet
dale where the water sparkled among the stones; and
the pallid loungers with their stamp of indulgence
differed unpleasantly from the hard, brown-faced men
he led.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s clear out,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;Is there anywhere
else to go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My rooms,&#8221; Lance suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I want something fresh to-night,&#8221; Dick replied
with a smile.
</p>
<p>Lance pondered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I can show you some keen card-play and
perhaps a clever game of billiards, besides a girl who&#8217;s
a great deal prettier than the dancer. But it&#8217;s four
miles out of town.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick glanced at his watch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can take you on the carrier,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
plenty of time yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They set off, and presently stopped at a tall iron
gate on the edge of a firwood. A glimmer of lights
indicated that a house stood at the end of the drive.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kenwardine will be glad to receive you as a friend
of mine,&#8221; Lance said; &#8220;and you needn&#8217;t play unless
you like. He&#8217;s fond of company and generally has
a number of young men about the place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A private gambling club?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no. You&#8217;re very far from the mark. Kenwardine
certainly likes a bet and sometimes runs a
bank, but all he wins wouldn&#8217;t do much to keep up a
place like this. However, you can see for yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick was not a gambler and did not play many
games, but he wanted a little excitement, and he looked
forward to it as he followed his cousin up the drive.

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>DICK&#8217;S TROUBLES BEGIN</h3>
</div>

<p>It was with mixed feelings that Clare Kenwardine
got down from the stopping train at a quiet station
and waited for the trap to take her home. The
trap was not in sight, but this did not surprise her,
for nobody in her father&#8217;s household was punctual.
Clare sometimes wondered why the elderly groom-gardener,
whose wages were very irregularly paid,
stayed on, unless it was because his weakness for
liquor prevented his getting a better post; but the
servants liked her father, for he seldom found fault
with them. Kenwardine had a curious charm, which
his daughter felt as strongly as anybody else, though
she was beginning to see his failings and had, indeed,
been somewhat shocked when she came home to live
with him not long before.
</p>
<p>Now she knitted her level brows as she sat down
and looked up the straight, white road. It ran
through pastures, and yellow cornfields where harvesters
were at work, to a moor on which the ling glowed
red in the fading light. Near the station a dark firwood
stretched back among the fields and a row of
beeches rose in dense masses of foliage beside the
road. There was no sound except the soft splash of
a stream. Everything was peaceful; but Clare was
young, and tranquillity was not what she desired.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
She had, indeed, had too much of it in the sleepy
cathedral town she had left.
</p>
<p>Her difficulty was that she felt drawn in two different
ways; for she had inherited something of her
father&#8217;s recklessness and love of pleasure, though her
mother, who died when Clare was young, had been
a shy Puritan. Clare was kept at school much longer
than usual; and when she insisted on coming home
she found herself puzzled by her father&#8217;s way of living.
Young men, and particularly army officers, frequented
the house; stylish women came down from
town, often without their husbands; and there was
generally some exciting amusement going on. This
had its attraction for Clare; but her delicate refinement
was sometimes offended, and once she was even
alarmed. One of the young men had shown his admiration
for her in a way that jarred, and soon afterward
there had been a brawl over a game of cards.
</p>
<p>Kenwardine had then suggested that she make a
long visit to her aunts, in the cathedral town. They
had received her gladly but she soon found her stay
there irksome. The aunts were austere, religious
women, who moved in a narrow groove and ordered
all their doings by a worn-out social code. Still, they
were kind and gave Clare to understand that she was
to stay with them always and have no more to do with
Kenwardine than duty demanded. The girl rebelled.
She shrank with innate dislike from license and dissipation,
but the life her aunts led was dreary, and she
could not give up her father. Though inexperienced,
she was intelligent and she saw that her path would not
be altogether smooth now that she was going home for
good. While she thought about it, the trap arrived
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
and the shabby groom drove her up the hill with confused
apologies.
</p>
<p>An hour or two after Clare reached home, Lance
and Dick Brandon entered the house and were met
by Kenwardine in the hall. He wore a velvet jacket
over his evening clothes and Dick noticed a wine-stain
on the breast. He was thin, but his figure was athletic,
although his hair was turning gray and there
were wrinkles about his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very glad to see your cousin,&#8221; he said to Lance,
and turned to Dick with a smile. &#8220;Soldiers have a
particular claim on our hospitality, but my house is
open to anybody of cheerful frame of mind. One
must relax now and then in times like these.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why I brought Dick,&#8221; Lance replied. &#8220;He
believes in tension. But I wonder whether your notion
of relaxing is getting lax?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a difference, though it&#8217;s sometimes rather
fine,&#8221; Kenwardine answered with a twinkle. &#8220;But
come in and amuse yourselves as you like. If you
want a drink, you know where to find it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They played a game of billiards and then went into
another room, where Dick lost a sovereign to Kenwardine.
After that, he sat in a corner, smoking and
languidly looking about, for he had been hard at work
since early morning. Two or three subaltern officers
from a neighboring camp stood by the table, besides
several other men whose sunburned faces indicated a
country life. The carpets and furniture were getting
shabby, but the room was large and handsome, with
well-molded cornices and paneled ceiling. The play
was not high and the men were quiet, but the room
was filled with cigar smoke and there was a smell of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
liquor. Dick did not object to drink and gambling
in moderation, though it was seldom that he indulged
in either. He found no satisfaction in that sort of
thing, and he now felt that some of Kenwardine&#8217;s
friends would do better to join the new armies than
to waste their time as they were doing.
</p>
<p>At last Kenwardine threw down the cards.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we have had enough for a time,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Shall we go into the music-room, for a change?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick followed the others, and looked up with surprise
when Clare came in. Lance had spoken of a
pretty girl, but she was not the type Dick had expected.
She wore a very plain white dress, with touches of
blue that emphasized her delicate coloring. Her hair
was a warm yellow with deeper tones, her features
were regular and well-defined, and Dick liked the level
glance of her clear, blue eyes. He thought they
rested on him curiously for a moment. She had
Kenwardine&#8217;s slender, well-balanced figure, and her
movements were graceful, but Dick&#8217;s strongest impression
was that she was out of place. Though perfectly
at ease, she did not fit into her environment:
she had a freshness that did not harmonize with cigar
smoke and the smell of drink.
</p>
<p>Clare gave him a pleasant smile when he was presented,
and after speaking to one or two of the others
she went to the piano when Kenwardine asked her to
sing. Dick, who was sitting nearest the instrument,
stooped to take a bundle of music from a cabinet she
opened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said; &#8220;you may put those down. I&#8217;m
afraid we have nothing quite so good, and perhaps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
it&#8217;s silly, but I&#8217;ve fallen back on our own composers
since the fourth of August.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick spread out the music, to display the titles.
</p>
<p>&#8220;These fellows have been dead some time,&#8221; he
argued humorously. &#8220;They&#8217;d probably disown their
descendants if they&#8217;d survived until now. But here&#8217;s
a Frenchman&#8217;s work. They&#8217;re on our side, and his
stuff is pretty good, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it&#8217;s certainly good; but I&#8217;d rather
sing something English to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She began a patriotic ballad Dick knew and liked.
He was not much of a musician, but his taste was
good. The song rang true; it was poetry and not
warlike jingle, but he had not heard it sung so well
before. Clare&#8217;s voice had been carefully trained and
she used it well, but he knew that she had grasped the
spirit of the song. One or two of the men who had
been sitting got up, two young subalterns stood very
stiff and straight, but Dick noted that Kenwardine did
not change his lounging attitude. He was smiling,
and Lance, glancing at him, looked amused. Dick
remembered this afterward, but he now felt that Lance
was not quite showing his usual good form.
</p>
<p>When the song was finished, Dick turned to Clare.
He wanted to begin talking to her before anybody
else came up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very fine. I don&#8217;t understand the technique
of music, but one felt that you got the song
just right. And then, the way you brought out the
idea!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what the mechanical part is for,&#8221; she answered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
with a smile and a touch of color. &#8220;As it
happens, I saw an infantry brigade on the march
to-day, and watched the long line of men go by in
the dust and sun. Perhaps that helps one to understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see them cross the bridge?&#8221; Dick asked
eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered; and he felt absurdly disappointed.
He would have liked to think that his work
had helped her to sing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you another like the first?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never sing more than once,&#8221; she smiled. Then
as Lance and another man came toward them, she
added, glancing at an open French window: &#8220;Besides,
the room is very hot. It would be cooler in the
garden.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick was not a man of affairs, but he was not a
fool. He knew that Clare Kenwardine was not the
girl to attempt his captivation merely because he had
shown himself susceptible. She wanted him to keep
the others off, and he thought he understood this as
he glanced at Lance&#8217;s companion. The fellow had a
coarse, red face and looked dissipated, and even Lance&#8217;s
well-bred air was somehow not so marked as usual.
Well, he was willing that she should make any use of
him that she liked.
</p>
<p>They passed the others, and after stopping to tell
Kenwardine that she was going out, Clare drew back
a curtain that covered part of the window. Dick
stepped across the ledge and, seeing that the stairs
below were iron and rather slippery, held out his hand
to Clare. The curtain swung back and cut off the
light, and when they were near the bottom the girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
tripped and clutched him. Her hand swept downward
from his shoulder across his chest and caught
the outside pocket of his coat, while he grasped her
waist to steady her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I was clumsy, but the
steps are awkward and my shoes are smooth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick was glad it was dark, for he felt confused.
The girl had rested upon him for a moment and it
had given him a thrill.
</p>
<p>They crossed the broad lawn. Half of it lay in
shadow, for a wood that rolled up a neighboring hillside
cut off the light of the low, half moon. The
air was still, it was too warm for dew, and there was
a smell of flowers&mdash;stocks, Dick thought, and he remembered
their pungent sweetness afterward when he
recalled that night. Clare kept in the moonlight, and
he noted the elusive glimmer of her white dress. She
wore no hat or wrap, and the pale illumination emphasized
the slenderness of her figure and lent her an
ethereal grace.
</p>
<p>They stopped at a bench beneath a copper-beech,
where the shadow of the leaves checkered with dark
blotches the girl&#8217;s white draperies and Dick&#8217;s uniform.
Some of the others had come out, for there
were voices in the gloom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you wonder why I brought you here,&#8221;
Clare said frankly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Dick answered. &#8220;If you had any reason,
I&#8217;m not curious. And I&#8217;d rather be outside.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;the light was rather glaring
and the room very hot.&#8221; She paused and added:
&#8220;Mr. Brandon&#8217;s your cousin?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is, and a very good sort. He brought me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
to-night, but I felt that it was, perhaps, something of
an intrusion when you came in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t feel that before?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick knew that he was on dangerous ground. He
must not admit that he suspected Kenwardine&#8217;s motive
for receiving promiscuous guests.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, not to the same extent. You see, Lance
knows everybody and everybody likes him. I thought
I might be welcome for his sake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s plain that you are fond of your cousin. But
why did you imagine that I should think your visit
an intrusion?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick was glad he sat in the shadow, for his face
was getting hot. He could not hint that he had expected
to find a rather daring coquette&mdash;the kind of
girl, in fact, one would imagine a semi-professional
gambler&#8217;s daughter to be. It now seemed possible
that he had misjudged Kenwardine; and he had certainly
misjudged Clare. The girl&#8217;s surroundings were
powerless to smirch her: Dick was sure of that.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; he answered awkwardly, &#8220;although
Lance obviously knows your father pretty well, it
doesn&#8217;t follow that he&#8217;s a friend of yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It does not,&#8221; she said in a curious tone. &#8220;But
do you know the man he was with?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw him before, and somehow I don&#8217;t
feel anxious to improve his acquaintance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a quick decision, isn&#8217;t it? Are you a judge
of character?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been badly mistaken,&#8221; Dick admitted with
a smile. &#8220;Still, I know the people I&#8217;m going to like.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
How is it I haven&#8217;t seen you about? We&#8217;re not very
far off and most of the people in the neighborhood
have driven over to our camp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I only came home to-night, after being away for
some time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick was relieved to learn this. He did not like
to think of her living at Kenwardine&#8217;s house and meeting
his friends. It was scarcely half an hour since
he met Clare Kenwardine, but she had, quite unconsciously
he thought, strongly impressed him. In fact,
he felt rather guilty about it. Since he was, in a manner,
expected to marry some one else, he had no business
to enjoy yielding to this stranger&#8217;s charm and to
thrill at her touch.
</p>
<p>They sat in silence for a few moments, and then
Lance strolled up with his companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget the time, Dick,&#8221; he remarked as he
passed. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t let him keep you too long,
Miss Kenwardine. He has an important errand to
do for his colonel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t mind, I won&#8217;t go just yet,&#8221; Dick
said to Clare; and understood from her silence that
she did not want to dismiss him.
</p>
<p>For the first time since they were boys, he was
angry with his cousin. It looked as if Lance had
meant to take him away when Miss Kenwardine
needed him. He was flattered to think she preferred
his society to the red-faced man&#8217;s, and had used him
to keep the other at a distance. Well, he would stay
to the last minute and protect her from the fellow,
or from anybody else.
</p>
<p>A little later Kenwardine joined them, and Dick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
knew that he must go. Clare gave him her hand with
a quick, grateful look that made his heart beat, and
Lance met him as he went into the house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re cutting it very fine,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Come
along; here&#8217;s your cap.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a moment! There&#8217;s an infantry man I asked
over to our camp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t time to look for him,&#8221; Lance answered,
and good-humoredly pushed Dick into the
hall. &#8220;Get off at once! A fellow I know will give
me a lift home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick ran down the drive and a few moments later
his motorcycle was humming up the road. He sped
through a dark firwood, where the cool air was filled
with resinous scent, and out across a hillside down
which the stocked sheaves stood in silvery rows, but
he noticed nothing except that the white strip of road
was clear in front. His thoughts were back in the
garden with Clare Kenwardine, and he could smell
the clogging sweetness of the stocks. This was folly,
and he changed the gear on moderate hills and altered
the control when the engine did not need it, to occupy
his mind; but the picture of the girl he carried away
with him would not be banished.
</p>
<p>For all that, he reached Storeton Grange in time
and, running up the drive, saw lights in the windows
and a car waiting at the door. Getting down and
stating his business, he was shown into a room where
a stern-faced man in uniform sat talking to another
in evening clothes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand you come from Captain Hallam,&#8221;
said the Colonel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. He sent me with some papers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what they are?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Plans of pontoons, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the Colonel, taking out a fountain
pen. &#8220;Let me have them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick put his hand into his breastpocket, which was
on the outside of his coat. The pocket was unbuttoned,
and the big envelope had gone. He hurriedly
felt the other pockets, but they too were empty, and his
face got red.
</p>
<p>The Colonel looked hard at him, and then made a
sign to the other man, who quietly went out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t got the plans! Did you leave them
behind?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; Dick said awkwardly. &#8220;I felt to see
if they were in my pocket when I left the camp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Colonel&#8217;s face hardened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you come straight here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. I had an hour or two&#8217;s leave.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And spent it with your friends? Had you anything
to drink?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As much as, or more than, usual?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps a little more,&#8221; Dick said in confusion.
</p>
<p>The Colonel studied him with searching eyes; and
then took some paper from a case on the table and
began to write. He put the note in an envelope and
gave it to Dick.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your Commanding Officer&#8217;s business to investigate
the matter and you&#8217;ll take him this. Report
yourself to him or to the Adjutant when you reach
camp. I&#8217;ll telegraph to see if you have done so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He raised his hand in sign of dismissal and Dick
went out, crushed with shame, and feeling that he was
already under arrest. If he were not in camp when
the telegram came, he would be treated as a deserter.

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE PUNISHMENT</h3>
</div>

<p>On reaching camp and reporting himself, Dick was
sent to his tent, where he slept until he was
aroused by the bustle at reveille. He had not expected
to sleep; but he was young and physically tired,
and the shock of trouble had, as sometimes happens, a
numbing effect. He awoke refreshed and composed,
though his heart was heavy as he dressed, because he
feared it was the last time that he would wear his
country&#8217;s uniform. The suspense was trying as he
waited until the morning parade was over; then he
was summoned to a tent where the Colonel and the
Adjutant sat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a telegram asking if you have arrived,&#8221; the
Colonel said in a curious, dry tone. &#8220;You must understand
that you have laid yourself open to grave
suspicion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Dick answered, wondering whether the
Colonel meant that it might have been better if he had
run away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. You admitted having received the
plans. What did you do with them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Buttoned them into the left pocket of my coat.
When I got to Storeton, the envelope was gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you account for that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t account for it, sir.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>The Colonel was silent for a few moments, and then
he looked fixedly at Dick.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your statements were very unsatisfactory last
night, and now that you have had time to think over the
matter, I advise you to be frank. It&#8217;s plain that you
have been guilty of gross negligence, but that is not
the worst. The drawings are of no direct use to the
enemy, but if they fell into their hands they might
supply a valuable hint of the use to which we mean
to put the pontoons. You see what this implies?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how we mean to use them, sir,
and I don&#8217;t want to hide anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a wise resolve,&#8221; the Colonel answered
meaningly; and Dick colored. After all, there was
something he meant to hide.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You took the plans with you when you left the
camp, three or four hours before you were due at
Storeton,&#8221; said the Adjutant. &#8220;Where did you go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To my cousin&#8217;s rooms in the town.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Lance Brandon&#8217;s,&#8221; said the Adjutant thoughtfully.
&#8220;Did you stay there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; we dined at The George.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A well-conducted house,&#8221; the Adjutant remarked.
&#8220;You took some wine at dinner?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two glasses of light claret.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then where did you go next?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To the new music-hall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And ordered drinks in the bar! Who suggested
this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t remember,&#8221; Dick replied with an angry
flush. &#8220;Of course, I see where you&#8217;re leading, but
I was quite sober when I left the hall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Adjutant&#8217;s expression puzzled him. He had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
felt that the man was not unfriendly, and now he
looked disappointed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure your statement makes things better,&#8221;
the Colonel observed with some dryness. &#8220;Did you
go straight to Storeton from the hall?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. I spent an hour at a friend&#8217;s house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whose house was it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick pondered for a few moments, and then looked
up resolutely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must decline to answer, sir. I&#8217;ve lost the plans
and must take the consequences; but I don&#8217;t see why
my private friends, who have nothing to do with it,
should be involved in the trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Adjutant leaned forward across the table and
said something quietly to the Colonel, and neither of
them spoke for the next minute or two. Dick was
sensible of physical as well as mental strain as he
stood stiffly in the middle of the tent. His knees felt
weak, little quivers ran through his limbs, and a ray
of hot sunshine struck through the hooked-back flap
into his face, but he dared not relax his rigid pose.
</p>
<p>The two officers looked puzzled but grave.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go back to your tent and stay there until I send
for you,&#8221; the Colonel said at last.
</p>
<p>Dick saluted and went out, and when he sat down
on his camp-bed he moodily lighted a cigarette and
tried to think. His military career was ended and
he was ruined; but this was not what occupied him
most. He was wondering whether Clare Kenwardine
had taken the plans. If so, it was his duty to accuse
her; but, actuated by some mysterious impulse, he had
refused.
</p>
<p>The longer he thought about it, the clearer her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
guilt became. He was a stranger and yet she had
suggested a stroll through the garden and had slipped
and clutched him as they went down the steps. Her
hand had rested on the pocket in which the envelope
was. She was the daughter of a man who kept a
private gaming house; it was not surprising that she
was an adventuress and had deceived him by her
clever acting. For all that, he could not condemn her;
there was a shadow of doubt; and even if she were
guilty, she had yielded to some strong pressure from
her father. His feelings, however, were puzzling.
He had spent less than an hour in her society and she
had ruined him, but he knew that he would remember
her as long as he lived.
</p>
<p>Dick&#8217;s common sense led him to smile bitterly. He
was behaving like a sentimental fool. On the whole,
it was a relief when the Adjutant came in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have known what the Colonel&#8217;s decision
would be,&#8221; he said with a hint of regret. &#8220;You&#8217;re
to be court-martialed. If you take my advice, you&#8217;ll
keep nothing back.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The court-martial was over and Dick could not
question the justice of its sentence&mdash;he was dismissed
from the army. Indeed, it was better than he had expected.
Somewhat to his surprise, the Adjutant
afterward saw him alone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thankful our official duty&#8217;s done,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Of course, I&#8217;m taking an irregular line, and if you
prefer not to talk&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You made me feel that you wanted to be my
friend,&#8221; Dick replied awkwardly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I may, perhaps, remark that you made a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
bad defense. In the army, it&#8217;s better to tell a plausible
tale and stick to it; we like an obvious explanation.
Now if you had admitted being slightly drunk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I was sober!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Adjutant smiled impatiently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So much the worse for you! If you had been
drunk, you&#8217;d have been turned out all the same, but
the reason would have been, so to speak, satisfactory.
Now you&#8217;re tainted by a worse suspicion. Personally,
I don&#8217;t think the lost plans have any value, but if they
had, it might have gone very hard with you.&#8221; He
paused and gave Dick a friendly glance. &#8220;Well, in
parting, I&#8217;ll give you a bit of advice. Stick to engineering,
which you have a talent for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went out and not long afterward Dick left the
camp in civilian&#8217;s clothes, but stopped his motorcycle
on the hill and stood looking back with a pain at his
heart. He saw the rows of tents stretched across the
smooth pasture, the flag he had been proud to serve
languidly flapping on the gentle breeze, and the water
sparkling about the bridge. Along the riverside, bare-armed
men in shirts and trousers were throwing up
banks of soil with shovels that flashed in the strong
light. He could see their cheerful brown faces and
a smart young subaltern taking out a measuring line.
Dick liked the boy, who now no doubt would pass him
without a look, and he envied him with the keenest
envy he had ever felt. He had loved his profession;
and he was turned out of it in disgrace.
</p>
<p>It was evening when he stood in the spacious library
at home, glad that the light was fading, as he confronted
his father, who sat with grim face in a big
leather chair. Dick had no brothers and sisters, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
his mother had died long before. He had not lived
much at home, and had been on good, more than affectionate,
terms with his father. Indeed, their relations
were marked by mutual indulgence, for Dick
had no interest outside his profession, while Mr.
Brandon occupied himself with politics and enjoyed
his prominent place in local society. He was conventional
and his manners were formal and dignified, but
Dick thought him very much like Lance, although he
had not Lance&#8217;s genial humor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said when Dick had finished, &#8220;you have
made a very bad mess of things and it is, of course,
impossible that you should remain here. In fact, you
have rendered it difficult for me to meet my neighbors
and take my usual part in public affairs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was the line Dick had expected him to take.
It was his father&#8217;s pride he had wounded and not his
heart. He did not know what to say and, turning
his head, he looked moodily out of the open window.
The lawn outside was beautifully kept and the flower-borders
were a blaze of tastefully assorted colors, but
there was something artificial and conventional about
the garden that was as marked in the house. Somehow
Dick had never really thought of the place as
home.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean to go away,&#8221; he said awkwardly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The puzzling thing is that you should deny having
drunk too much,&#8221; Brandon resumed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I hadn&#8217;t done so! You look at it as the
others did. Why should it make matters better if
I&#8217;d owned to being drunk?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Drunkenness,&#8221; his father answered, &#8220;is now an
offense against good taste, but not long ago it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
thought a rather gentlemanly vice, and a certain toleration
is still extended to the man who does wrong in
liquor. Perhaps this isn&#8217;t logical, but you must take
the world as you find it. I had expected you to learn
more in the army than you seem to have picked up.
Did you imagine that your promotion depended altogether
upon your planning trenches and gun-pits
well?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That kind of thing is going to count in the new
armies,&#8221; Dick replied. &#8220;Being popular on guest-night
at the mess won&#8217;t help a man to hold his trench
or work his gun under heavy fire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Brandon frowned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t have an opportunity for showing what
you can do. I don&#8217;t know where you got your utilitarian,
radical views; but we&#8217;ll keep to the point.
Where do you think of going?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To New York, to begin with.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not Montreal or Cape Town?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Dick said awkwardly, &#8220;after what has
happened, I&#8217;d rather not live on British soil.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why not try Hamburg?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick flushed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You might have spared me that, sir! I lost the
plans; I didn&#8217;t sell them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. This interview is naturally painful
to us both and we&#8217;ll cut it short, but I have something
to say. It will not be forgotten that you were
turned out of the army, and if you succeeded me, the
ugly story would be whispered when you took any
public post. I cannot have our name tainted and will
therefore leave the house and part of my property to
your cousin. Whether you inherit the rest or not will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
depend upon yourself. In the meantime, I am prepared
to make you an allowance, on the understanding
that you stay abroad until you are sent for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick faced his father, standing very straight, with
knitted brows.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir, but I will take nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;May I ask why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d looked at the thing differently and shown
a little kindness, it would have cut me to the quick,&#8221;
Dick said hoarsely. &#8220;I&#8217;m not a thief and a traitor,
though I&#8217;ve been a fool, and it hurts to know what
you think. I&#8217;m going away to-morrow and I&#8217;ll get
on, somehow, without your help. I don&#8217;t know that
I&#8217;ll come back if you do send for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem to understand your position, but
you may come to realize it before very long,&#8221; Brandon
replied.
</p>
<p>He got up and Dick left the library; but he did not
sleep that night. It had been hard to meet his father
and what he said had left a wound that would take
long to heal. Now he must say good-by to Helen.
This would need courage, but Dick meant to see her.
It was the girl&#8217;s right that she should hear his story,
and he would not steal away like a cur. He did not
think Helen was really fond of him, though he
imagined that she would have acquiesced in her relatives&#8217;
plans for them both had things been different.
Now, of course, that was done with, but he must say
good-by and she might show some regret or sympathy.
He did not want her to suffer, but he did not
think she would feel the parting much; and she would
not treat him as his father had done.
</p>
<p>When he called the next morning at an old country
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
house, he was told that Miss Massie was in the
garden, and going there, he stopped abruptly at a gap
in a shrubbery. Beyond the opening there was a
stretch of smooth grass, checkered by moving shadow,
and at one side a row of gladioli glowed against the
paler bloom of yellow dahlias. Helen Massie held a
bunch of the tall crimson spikes, and Dick thought
as he watched her with a beating heart that she was
like the flowers. They were splendid in form and
color, but there was nothing soft or delicate in their
aggressive beauty. Helen&#8217;s hair was dark and her
color high, her black eyes were bright, and her yellow
dress showed a finely outlined form. Dick knew
that she was proud, resolute, and self-confident.
</p>
<p>Then she turned her head and saw him, and he knew
that she had heard of his disgrace, for her color deepened
and her glance was rather hard than sympathetic.
The hand that held the flowers dropped to her side,
but she waited until he came up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you know, and it doesn&#8217;t matter who told
you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I felt I had to come before I went
away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered calmly, &#8220;I heard. You have
courage, Dick; but perhaps a note would have been
enough, and more considerate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick wondered gloomily whether she meant that
he might have saved her pain by staying away, or that
he had involved her in his disgrace by coming, since
his visit would be talked about. He reflected bitterly
that the latter was more probable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we have been pretty good friends
and I&#8217;m leaving the country. I don&#8217;t suppose I shall
come back again.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When do you go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;I must catch the train at
noon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Helen&#8217;s manner did not encourage any indulgence
in sentiment and he half resented this, although it
made things easier. He could not say he had come to
give her up, because there had been no formal engagement.
Still he had expected some sign of pity or
regret.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t defend yourself,&#8221; she remarked thoughtfully.
&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you have fought it out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was nothing to fight for. I lost the papers
I was trusted with; one can&#8217;t get over that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But people may imagine you did something
worse.&#8221; She paused for a moment and added:
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you care what I might think?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick looked at her steadily. &#8220;You ought to know.
Do you believe it&#8217;s possible I stole and meant to sell
the plans?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said with a touch of color. &#8220;But I
would have liked you, for your friends&#8217; sake, to try to
clear yourself. If you had lost the papers, they would
have been found and sent back; as they were not, it
looks as if you had been robbed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That she could reason this out calmly struck Dick
as curious, although he had long known that Helen
was ruled by her brain and not her heart.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been careless and there&#8217;s nothing to be done
but take my punishment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She gave him a keen glance. &#8220;Are you hiding
something, Dick? It&#8217;s your duty to tell all that you
suspect.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick winced. Helen was right; it was his duty, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
he was not going to carry it out. He began to see
what this meant, but his resolution did not falter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I knew I&#8217;d been robbed, it would be different,
but I don&#8217;t, and if I blamed people who were found to
be innocent, I&#8217;d only make matters worse for myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose that&#8217;s true,&#8221; she agreed coldly. &#8220;However,
you have made your choice and it&#8217;s too late now.
Where are you going, Dick?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To New York by the first boat from Liverpool.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He waited, watching her and wondering whether
she would ask him to stop, but she said quietly:
&#8220;Well, I shall, no doubt, hear how you get on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unlikely,&#8221; he answered in a hard voice. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
lost my friends with my character. The best thing I
can do is to leave them alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then he looked at his watch, and she gave him her
hand. &#8220;For all that, I wish you good luck, Dick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She let him go, and as he went back to the gate he
reflected that Helen had taken the proper and tactful
line by dismissing him as if he were nothing more than
an acquaintance. He could be nothing more now, and
to yield to sentiment would have been painful and
foolish; but it hurt him that she had realized this.
</p>
<p>When he wheeled his bicycle away from the gate he
saw a boy who helped his father&#8217;s gardener running
along the road, and waited until he came up, hot and
panting. The boy held out a small envelope.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It came after you left, Mr. Dick,&#8221; he gasped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you have been very quick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lad smiled, for Dick was a favorite with his
father&#8217;s servants.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d like to have the note,&#8221; he answered,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
and added awkwardly: &#8220;Besides, I didn&#8217;t see
you when you went.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was the first hint of kindness Dick had received
since his disgrace and he took the lad&#8217;s hand before
he gave him half a crown, though he knew that he must
practise stern economy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you and good-by, Jim. You must have
taken some trouble to catch me,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Then he opened the envelope and his look softened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard of your misfortune and am very sorry,
but something tells me that you are not to blame,&#8221; the
note ran, and was signed &#8220;Clare Kenwardine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a moment or two Dick was sensible of keen
relief and satisfaction; and then his mood changed.
This was the girl who had robbed and ruined him; she
must think him a fool! Tearing up the note, he
mounted his bicycle and rode off to the station in a
very bitter frame of mind.

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>ADVERSITY</h3>
</div>

<p>When he had sold his motorcycle at Liverpool,
Dick found it would be prudent to take
a third-class passage, but regretted this as soon as the
liner left the St. George&#8217;s channel. The food, though
badly served, was good of its kind, and his berth was
comfortable enough for a man who had lived under
canvas, but when the hatches were closed on account
of bad weather the foul air of the steerage sickened
him and the habits of his companions left much to be
desired. It was difficult to take refuge in the open
air, because the steerage deck was swept by bitter spray
and often flooded as the big ship lurched across the
Atlantic against a western gale.
</p>
<p>A spray-cloud veiled her forward when the bows
plunged into a comber&#8217;s hollow side, and then as they
swung up until her forefoot was clear, foam and green
water poured aft in cataracts. Sometimes much of
her hull before the bridge sank into the crest of a half-mile
sea and lower decks and alleyways looked like
rivers. The gale held all the way across, and Dick
felt jaded and gloomy when they steamed into New
York, a day late. He had some trouble with the immigration
officers, who asked awkward questions about
his occupation and his reason for giving it up, but he
satisfied them at length and was allowed to land.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></p>
<p>The first few days he spent in New York helped
him to realize the change in his fortunes and the difficulties
he must face. Until the night he lost the plans,
he had scarcely known a care; life had been made easy,
and his future had looked safe. He had seldom denied
himself anything; he had started well on a career
he liked, and all his thoughts were centered on fitting
himself for it. Extravagance was not a failing of his,
but he had always had more money than would satisfy
his somewhat simple needs. Now, however, there was
an alarming difference.
</p>
<p>To begin with, it was obvious that he could only
stay for a very limited time at the cheap hotel he went
to, and his efforts to find employment brought him
sharp rebuffs. Business men who needed assistance
asked him curt questions about his training and experience,
and when he could not answer satisfactorily
promptly got rid of him. Then he tried manual labor
and found employment almost as hard to get. The
few dollars he earned at casual jobs did not pay his
board at the hotel where he lived in squalid discomfort,
but matters got worse when he was forced to leave it
and take refuge in a big tenement house, overcrowded
with unsavory foreigners from eastern Europe. New
York was then sweltering under a heat wave, and he
came home, tired by heavy toil or sickened by disappointment,
to pass nights of torment in a stifling, foul-smelling
room.
</p>
<p>He bore it for some weeks and then, when his small
stock of money was melting fast, set off to try his
fortune in the manufacturing towns of Pennsylvania
and Ohio. Here he found work was to be had, but
the best paid kind was barred to untrained men by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
Trade-union rules, and the rest was done by Poles and
Ruthenians, who led a squalid semi-communistic life in
surroundings that revolted him. Still, he could not
be fastidious and took such work as he could get, until
one rainy evening when he walked home dejectedly
after several days of enforced idleness. A labor
agent&#8217;s window caught his eye and he stopped amidst
the crowd that jostled him on the wet sidewalk to read
the notices displayed.
</p>
<p>One ticket stated that white men, and particularly
live mechanics, were wanted for a job down South,
but Dick hesitated for a few minutes, fingering a
dollar in his pocket. Carefully spent, it would buy
him his supper and leave something towards his meals
next day, and he had been walking about since morning
without food. If he went without his supper,
the agent, in exchange for the dollar, would give him
the address of the man who wanted help, but Dick
knew from experience that it did not follow that he
would be engaged. Still, one must risk something
and the situation was getting desperate. He entered
the office and a clerk handed him a card.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s right across the town, but you&#8217;d better get
there quick,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The job&#8217;s a snap and I&#8217;ve
sent a lot of men along.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick boarded a street-car that took him part of
the way, but he had to walk the rest, and was tired
and wet when he reached an office in a side street.
A smart clerk took the card and gave him a critical
glance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks as if we were going to be full up, but
I&#8217;ll put down your name and you can come back in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
the morning,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;What do you call yourself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A civil engineer,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;But where is the
job and what&#8217;s the pay?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess Central America is near enough; mighty
fine country, where rum&#8217;s good and cheap. Pay&#8217;ll
pan out about two-fifty, or perhaps three dollars if
you&#8217;re extra smart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can get as much here,&#8221; Dick objected, thinking
it unwise to seem eager.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why don&#8217;t you get it?&#8221; the clerk inquired.
&#8220;Anyhow, you won&#8217;t be charged for board and all
you&#8217;ll have to do is to drive breeds and niggers. It&#8217;s
a soft thing, sure, but you can light out now and come
back if you feel it&#8217;s good enough for you to take your
chance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick went away, and had reached the landing when
a man who wore loose, gray clothes and a big, soft
hat, met him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been applying for the job in the South.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The other gave him a searching glance and Dick
thought he noted his anxious look and wet and shabby
clothes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What can you do?&#8221; he resumed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To begin with, I can measure cubic quantities,
plan out excavating work, and use the level. If this
kind of thing&#8217;s not wanted, I can handle a spade.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have you done your digging?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In this city. Laying sewers for a contractor, who,
the boys said, had to squeeze us to make good the graft
he put up to get the job.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>The other nodded. &#8220;That&#8217;s so; I know the man.
You can use a spade all right if you satisfied him.
But the sewer&#8217;s not finished yet; why did you quit?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The foreman fired three or four of us to make
room for friends that a saloon-keeper who commands
some votes sent along.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the other, smiling, &#8220;you seem to understand
how our city bosses fix these things. But
my job will mean pretty tough work. Are you sure
you want it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t find another,&#8221; Dick answered frankly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, I&#8217;ll put you on. Look round to-morrow
and get your orders. I&#8217;ve a notion that you&#8217;re
up against it; here&#8217;s a dollar on account.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick took the money. He rather liked the man,
whose abruptness was disarmed by his twinkling smile.
For the first time, with one exception, during his search
for employment, he had been treated as a human being
instead of an instrument for doing a certain
amount of work.
</p>
<p>It was raining hard when he reached the street, and
supper would be over before he arrived at his cheap
hotel, where one must eat at fixed times or wait for
the next meal. There was, however, a small restaurant
with an Italian name outside a few blocks further
on, and going in he was served with well-cooked food
and afterwards sat in a corner smoking and thinking
hard. He now felt more cheerful; but the future was
dark and he realized the difficulties in his path.
</p>
<p>American industry was highly organized. The man
who hoped for advancement must specialize and
make himself master of some particular branch.
Dick had specialized in England, and thought he knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
his subject, but could not use his knowledge. The
Americans to whom he tried to sell it would have
none of him, and Dick owned that he could not blame
them; since it was natural to suppose that the man
who was unfaithful to his country would not be loyal
to his employer. When he looked for other openings,
he found capital and labor arrayed in hostile
camps. There was mechanical work he was able to
do, but this was not allowed, because the organized
workers, who had fought stubbornly for a certain
standard of comfort, refused to let untrained outsiders
share the benefits they had won.
</p>
<p>Business was left; but it needed money, and if he
tried to enter it as a clerk, he must first obtain smart
clothes and find somebody to certify his ability and
character, which was impossible. It looked as if he
must be content with manual labor. The wages it
commanded were not low and he was physically strong,
but he shrank from the lives the lower ranks of toilers
led when their work was done. The crowded bunk-house
and squalid tenement revolted him. Still, he
was young and optimistic; his luck might change when
he went South and chance give him an opportunity
of breaking through the barriers that shut him in. He
sat in the corner, pondering, until it got late and the
tired Italian politely turned him out.
</p>
<p>Next morning he joined a group of waiting men at
the railroad station. They had a dejected look as they
sat upon their bundles outside the agent&#8217;s office, except
for three or four who were cheerfully drunk.
Their clothes were shabby and of different kinds, for
some wore cheap store-suits and some work-stained
overalls. It was obvious that adversity had brought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
them together, and Dick did not think they would
make amiable companions. About half appeared to be
Americans, but he could not determine the nationality
of the rest, who grumbled in uncouth English with
different accents.
</p>
<p>By and by the clerk whom Dick had met came out
of the office with a bundle of tickets, which he distributed,
and soon afterwards the train rolled into
the depot. Dick was not pleased to find that a car
had been reserved for the party, since he would sooner
have traveled with the ordinary passengers. Indeed,
when a dispute began as the train moved slowly
through the wet street, he left the car. In passing
through the next, he met the conductor, who asked
for his ticket, and after tearing off a section of the
long paper, gave him a card, which he gruffly ordered
him to stick in his hat. Then he put his hand on
Dick&#8217;s shoulder, and pushed him back through the vestibule.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s your car behind and you&#8217;ll stop right there,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Next time you come out we&#8217;ll put you off
the train.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick resigned himself, but stopped on the front
platform and looked back as the train jolted across
a rattling bridge. A wide, yellow river ran beneath
it, and the tall factories and rows of dingy houses
were fading in the rain and smoke on the other side.
Dick watched them until they grew indistinct, and
then his heart felt lighter. He had endured much
in the grimy town; but all that was over. After
confronting, with instinctive shrinking, industry&#8217;s
grimmest aspect, he was traveling toward the light
and glamour of the South.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>Entering the smoking compartment, he found the
disturbance had subsided, and presently fell into talk
with a man on the opposite seat who asked for some
tobacco. He told Dick he was a locomotive fireman,
but had got into trouble, the nature of which he did
not disclose. Dick never learned much more about
his past than this, but their acquaintance ripened and
Kemp proved a useful friend.
</p>
<p>It was getting dark when they reached an Atlantic
port and were lined up on the terminal platform by
a man who read out a list of their names. He expressed
his opinion of them with sarcastic vigor when
it was discovered that three of the party had left
the train on the way; and then packed the rest into
waiting automobiles, which conveyed them to the
wharf as fast as the machines would go.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you won&#8217;t quit this journey. The man who
jumps off will sure get hurt,&#8221; he remarked as they
started.
</p>
<p>In spite of his precautions, another of the gang was
missing when they alighted, and Kemp, the fireman,
grinned at Dick.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That fellow&#8217;s not so smart as he allows,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;He&#8217;d have gone in the last car, where he could see
in front, if he&#8217;d known his job.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were hustled up a steamer&#8217;s gangway and taken
to the after end of the deck, where their conductor
turned his back on them for a few minutes while he
spoke to a mate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now&#8217;s your time,&#8221; said Kemp, &#8220;if you feel you
want to quit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick looked about. The spar-deck, on which the
boats were stowed, covered the spot where he stood,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
and the passage beneath the stanchions was dark.
There was nobody at the top of the gangway under
the big cargo-lamp, and its illumination did not carry
far across the wharf. If he could reach the latter,
he would soon be lost in the gloom, and he was sensible
of a curious impulse that urged him to flight. It
almost amounted to panic, and he imagined that the
other men&#8217;s desertion must have daunted him. For
a few moments he struggled with the feeling and then
conquered it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said firmly; &#8220;I&#8217;ll see the thing through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kemp nodded. &#8220;Well, I guess it&#8217;s too late now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Two seamen, sent by the mate, went to the top
of the gangway, and the fellow who had brought the
party from the station stood on guard near. Dick
afterward realized that much depended on the choice
he swiftly made and wondered whether it was quite
by chance he did so.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were pretty near going,&#8221; his companion resumed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Dick, thoughtfully; &#8220;I believe I was.
As a matter of fact, I don&#8217;t know why I stopped.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The other smiled. &#8220;I&#8217;ve felt like that about risky
jobs I took. Sometimes I lit out, and sometimes I
didn&#8217;t, but found out afterward I was right either
way. If you feel you have to go, the best thing you
can do is to get a move on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick agreed with this. He did not understand it,
but knew that while he had still had time to escape
down the gangway and felt strongly tempted to do so,
it was impressed upon him that he must remain.
</p>
<p>A few minutes later their conductor left them with
a sarcastic farewell, the ropes were cast off, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
steamer swung out from the wharf. When, with engines
throbbing steadily, she headed down the bay,
Dick went to his berth, and on getting up next morning
found the American coast had sunk to a low, gray
streak to starboard. A fresh southwest breeze was
blowing under a cloudy sky and the vessel, rolling
viciously, lurched across the white-topped combers of
the warm Gulf Stream.
</p>
<p>After breakfast, some of his companions gathered
into listless, grumbling groups, and some brought out
packs of greasy cards, but Dick sat by himself, wondering
with more buoyant feelings what lay before
him. He had known trouble and somehow weathered
it, and now he was bound to a country where the sun
was shining. It was pleasant to feel the soft air on
his face and the swing of the spray-veiled bows. After
all, good fortune might await him down South.

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>THE CONCRETE TRUCK</h3>
</div>

<p>It was very hot in the deep hollow that pierced
the mountain range behind Santa Brigida on the
Caribbean Sea. The black peaks cut against a glaring
sky and the steep slopes of red soil and volcanic
cinders on one side of the ravine were dazzlingly
bright. The other was steeped in blue shadow that
scarcely seemed to temper the heat, and the dark-skinned
men who languidly packed the ballast among
the ties of a narrow-gage railroad that wound up
the hill panted as they swung their shovels. At its
lower end, the ravine opened on to a valley that got
greener as it ran down to the glittering sea, on the
edge of which feathery palms clustered round Santa
Brigida.
</p>
<p>The old city, dominated by its twin, cathedral towers,
shone ethereally white in the distance, with a
narrow fringe of flashing surf between it and the vivid
blue of the Caribbean. It was a thriving place, as
the black dots of steamers in the roadstead showed,
for of late years American enterprise had broken in
upon its lethargic calm. The population was, for the
most part, of Spanish stock that had been weakened
by infusions of Indian and negro blood, but there were
a number of Chinamen, and French Creoles. Besides
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
these, Americans, Britons, and European adventurers
had established themselves, and the town was a hotbed
of commercial and political intrigue. The newcomers
were frankly there for what they could get
and fought cunningly for trading and agricultural concessions.
The leading citizens of comparatively pure
Spanish strain despised the grasping foreigners in
their hearts, but as a rule took their money and helped
them in their plots. Moreover, they opened a handsome
casino and less reputable gambling houses with
the object of collecting further toll.
</p>
<p>Such wealth as the country enjoyed was largely
derived from the fertile soil, but the district about
Santa Brigida was less productive than the rest and
had been long neglected. There was rain enough all
round, but much of the moisture condensed on the opposite
side of the range and left the slopes behind the
town comparatively arid. To remedy this an irrigation
scheme was being carried out by American capitalists,
and the narrow-gage railroad formed part of
the undertaking.
</p>
<p>A man dressed in rather baggy, gray clothes and a
big, soft hat sat in the shadow of the rock. His thin
face had been recently browned by the sun, for the
paler color where his hat shaded it showed that he
was used to a northern climate. Though his pose was
relaxed and he had a cigar in his mouth, there was
a hint of energy about him and he was following the
curves of the railroad with keenly observant eyes. A
girl in white dress of fashionable cut sat near him,
holding a green-lined sunshade, for although they were
in the shadow the light was strong. The likeness between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
them indicated they were father and daughter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect you&#8217;re feeling it pretty hot,&#8221; Fuller remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not oppressive and I rather like the brightness,&#8221;
the girl replied. &#8220;Besides, it&#8217;s cool enough
about the tent after the sun goes behind the range.
Of course, you are used to the climate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was, but that was twenty-four years ago and
before you were born. Got my first lift with the ten
thousand dollars I made in the next state down this
coast, besides the ague and shivers that have never
quite left me. However, it&#8217;s pretty healthy up here,
and I guess it ought to suit Jake all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ida Fuller looked thoughtful, and her pensive expression
added to the charm of her attractive face.
She had her father&#8217;s keen eyes, but they were, like her
hair, a soft dark-brown; and the molding of brows
and nose and mouth was rather firm than delicate.
While her features hinted at decision of character,
there was nothing aggressive in her look, which, indeed,
was marked by a gracious calm. Though she
was tall, her figure was slender.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she agreed, &#8220;if he would stay up here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Fuller nodded. &#8220;I&#8217;d have to fix him up with work
enough to keep him busy, and ask for a full-length report
once a week. That would show me what he was
doing and he&#8217;d have to stick right to his job to find
out what was going on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless he got somebody to tell him, or perhaps
write the report. Jake, you know, is smart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re fond of your brother, but I sometimes
think you&#8217;re a bit hard on him. I admit I was badly
riled when they turned him down from Yale, but it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
was a harmless fool-trick he played, and when he
owned up squarely I had to let it go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Jake&#8217;s way. You can&#8217;t be angry with him.
Still, perhaps, it&#8217;s a dangerous gift. It might be better
for him if he got hurt now and then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Fuller, who did not answer, watched her, as she
pondered. Her mother had died long ago, and Fuller,
who was largely occupied by his business, knew that
Jake might have got into worse trouble but for the
care Ida had exercised. He admitted that his daughter,
rather than himself, had brought up the lad, and
her influence had been wholly for good. By and by
she glanced at Santa Brigida.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the casino and other attractions down there
I&#8217;m afraid of. If you had some older man you could
trust to look after Jake, one would feel more satisfied.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Fuller with a twinkle, &#8220;there&#8217;s nobody
I know who could fill the bill, and I&#8217;m not sure the
older men are much steadier than the rest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stopped as a puff of smoke rose at the lower
end of the ravine and moved up the hill. Then a flash
of twinkling metal broke out among the rocks, and
Ida saw that a small locomotive was climbing the steep
track.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s bringing up concrete blocks for the dam,&#8221;
Fuller resumed. &#8220;We use them large in the lower
courses, and I had the bogie car they&#8217;re loaded on
specially built for the job; but I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;ll have
to put down some pieces of the line again. The
grade&#8217;s pretty stiff and the curves are sharp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ida was not bored by these details. She liked her
father to talk to her about his business, and her interest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
was quickly roused. Fuller, who was proud of her
keen intelligence, told her much, and she knew the importance
of the irrigation scheme he had embarked
upon. Land in the arid belt could be obtained on
favorable terms and, Fuller thought, be made as productive
as that watered by the natural rainfall. It
was, however, mainly because he had talked about finding
her scapegrace brother employment on the work
that Ida had made him take her South.
</p>
<p>As she glanced at the track she noted that room for
it had been dug out of the hillside, which was seamed
by gullies that the rails twisted round. The loose soil,
consisting largely of volcanic cinders, appeared to offer
a very unsafe support. It had slipped away here
and there, leaving gaps between the ties, which were
unevenly laid and at the sharper bends overhung the
steep slope below. In the meantime, the small locomotive
came nearer, panting loudly and throwing up
showers of sparks, and Ida remarked how the rails
bent and then sprang up again as the truck, which carried
two ponderous blocks of stone, rolled over them.
The engine rocked, sparks flashed among the wheels
as their flanges bit the curves, and she wondered what
the driver felt or if he had got used to his rather dangerous
work.
</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Dick Brandon, who drove the
engine, felt some nervous strain. He had applied for
the post at Kemp&#8217;s suggestion, after the latter had
given him a few lessons in locomotive work, and had
since been sorry that he had obtained it. Still he had
now a room to himself at the shed where the engine
was kept, and a half-breed fireman to help him with
the heavier part of his task. He preferred this to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
living in a hot bunk-house and carrying bags of cement
in the grinding mill, though he knew there was
a certain risk of his plunging down the ravine with his
engine.
</p>
<p>The boiler primed when he started and was not
steaming well. The pistons banged alarmingly as they
compressed the water that spurted from the drain-cocks,
and his progress was marked by violent jerks
that jarred the couplings of the bogie truck. Though
Dick only wore a greasy shirt and overall trousers,
he felt the oppressive heat, and his eyes ached with
the glare as he gazed up the climbing track. The dust
that rolled about the engine dimmed the glasses, the
footplate rattled, and it looked as if his fireman was
performing a clumsy dance.
</p>
<p>By and by he rather doubtfully opened the throttle
to its widest. If the boiler primed again, he might
knock out the cylinder-heads, but there was a steep
pitch in front that was difficult to climb. The short
locomotive rocked and hammered, the wheels skidded
and gripped again, and Dick took his hand from the
lever to dash the sweat from his eyes.
</p>
<p>They were going up, and he would be past the
worst if he could get his load round the curve ahead.
They were half way round when there was a clang
behind him and the engine seemed to leap forward.
Glancing over his shoulder as he shut off steam, Dick
saw the fireman gazing back, and a wide gap between
the concrete blocks and his load of coal. The couplings
had snapped as they strained round the bend and
the truck would run down the incline until it smashed
through the sheds that held the grinding and mixing
plant at the bottom. He saw that prompt action was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
needed, and reversing the machinery, gave the fireman
an order in uncouth Castilian.
</p>
<p>The fellow looked at him stupidly, as if his nerve
had failed, or he thought the order too risky to obey.
There was only one thing to be done, and since it must
be done at once, Dick must undertake it himself.
The engine was now running down the line after the
truck, which had not gathered much speed yet, and he
climbed across the coal and dropped upon the rear
buffer-frame. Balancing himself upon it, he waited
until the gap between him and the truck got narrower,
and then put his hand on top of the concrete and
swung himself across. He got his foot upon the side
of the car and made his way along, holding the top of
the block, while the dust rolled about him and he
thought he would be jolted off. Indeed, there was
only an inch-wide ledge of smooth iron to support his
foot, which slipped once or twice; but he reached the
brake-gear and screwed it down. Then, crawling
back, he hooked on the spare coupling and returned,
breathless and shaky, to his engine. A minute or two
later he brought it to a stop and had got down upon
the line when somebody called him.
</p>
<p>Looking round, he saw Fuller standing near, and
knew him as the man who had given him the dollar
in the American town. He had heard that his employer
had come out to see what progress was being
made, but had not yet encountered him. He did not
notice Ida, who was sitting in the shadow of the rock.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were smart,&#8221; said Fuller. &#8220;There&#8217;d have
been an ugly smash if the blocks had got away down
the grade. But why didn&#8217;t you stick to the throttle
and send your fireman?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he understood what he ought to do,
and there was no time to explain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Fuller nodded. &#8220;So you did it yourself! But
why didn&#8217;t you push the car? You could have held
her up better then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t get behind it. The loop-track down at
the switches has caved in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. But it&#8217;s a stiff grade and you didn&#8217;t seem
to be hustling your engine much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The boiler was priming and I was afraid of the
cylinders.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so. You pumped up the water pretty high?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; it was at the usual working level,&#8221; said Dick,
who paused and resumed thoughtfully: &#8220;I can&#8217;t account
for the thing. Why does a boiler prime?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There are one or two obvious reasons for a boiler&#8217;s
priming; that is to say, throwing water as well as
steam into the engine, but this sometimes happens
when no cause can be assigned, and Fuller saw that
Dick did not expect an answer to his question. It
was rather an exclamation, prompted by his failure
to solve a fascinating problem, and as such indicated
that his interest in his task was not confined to the
earning of a living. Fuller recognized the mind of
the engineer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;there&#8217;s a good deal we don&#8217;t
know yet about the action of fluids under pressure.
But do you find the grade awkward when she&#8217;s steaming
properly?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can get up. Still, I think it will soon cost you
as much in extra fuel as it would to relay this bit of
line. Two hundred cubic yards cut out at the bend
would make things much easier.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Two hundred yards?&#8221; said Fuller, studying the
spot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two hundred and fifty at the outside,&#8221; Dick answered
confidently, and then felt embarrassed as he saw
Miss Fuller for the first time. His clothes were few
and dirty and he was awkwardly conscious that his
hands and face were black. But his employer claimed
his attention.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you reckon the weight of the stuff?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick told him after a short silence, and Fuller
asked: &#8220;Two-thousand-pound tons?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I turned it into American weight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Fuller, &#8220;you must get on with your
job now, but come up to my tent after supper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick started his locomotive, and when it panted
away up the incline Fuller looked at his daughter with
a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of that young man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has a nice face. Of course he&#8217;s not the type
one would expect to find driving a locomotive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; said Fuller. &#8220;I&#8217;m not talking about his
looks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor am I, in the way you mean,&#8221; Ida rejoined.
&#8220;I thought he looked honest, though perhaps reliable
is nearest what I felt. Then he was very professional.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Fuller nodded. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I like. The man
who puts his job before what he gets for it naturally
makes the best work. What do you think of his manner?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was good; confident, but not assertive, with
just the right note of deference,&#8221; Ida answered, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
then laughed. &#8220;It rather broke down after he saw
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not surprising, anyhow. I expect he&#8217;s
used to wearing different clothes and more of them
when he meets stylish young women. It doesn&#8217;t follow
that the young fellow isn&#8217;t human because he&#8217;s
professional. However, I want to see what the boys
are doing farther on.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>A STEP UP</h3>
</div>

<p>Dusk was falling when Dick went to keep his
appointment with his employer. Fireflies glimmered
in the brush beside the path, and the lights of
Santa Brigida flashed in a brilliant cluster on the edge
of the shadowy sea. High above, rugged peaks cut
black against the sky, and the land breeze that swept
their lower slopes brought with it instead of coolness
a warm, spicy smell. There was more foliage
when Dick reached the foot of a projecting spur, for
a dark belt of forest rolled down the hill; and by and
by he saw a big tent, that gleamed with a softened
radiance like a paper lantern, among a clump of palms.
It seemed to be well lighted inside, and Dick remembered
having heard orders for electric wires to be connected
with the power-house at the dam.
</p>
<p>Fuller obviously meant to give his daughter all the
civilized comfort possible, and Dick was glad he had
been able to find a clean duck suit, though he was not
sure he had succeeded in removing all the oily grime
from his face. Nothing could be done with his hands.
The knuckles were scarred, the nails broken, and the
black grease from the engine had worked into his
skin. Still, this did not matter much, because he had
gradually overcome his fastidiousness and it was not
likely that Miss Fuller would notice him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>She was, however, sitting outside the tent, from
which an awning extended so as to convert its front
into a covered veranda, and Dick was half surprised
when she gave him a smile of recognition that warranted
his taking off his hat. Then Fuller, beckoning
him to come forward, switched on another lamp and
the light fell on a table covered with plans. Dick
stopped when he reached it and waited, not knowing
how his employer meant to receive him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; said Fuller, indicating a chair, and
then gave him one of the plans, some paper, and a
fountain pen. &#8220;Study that piece of digging and let
me know the weight of stuff to be moved, the number
of men you&#8217;d use, and what you think the job would
cost.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick set to work, and at once became absorbed.
Twenty minutes passed and he did not move or speak,
nor did he see the smile with which Ida answered
Fuller&#8217;s look. In another ten minutes he put down
the pen and gave Fuller his calculations.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s near it, sir. I&#8217;m reckoning on the
use of colored peons.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Fuller nodded. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t left much margin
for what we call contingencies. But they&#8217;re going to
bring us some coffee. Will you take a cigar?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A Chinaman brought out a silver coffee-pot on a
tray, which he placed on a folding table in front of
Ida, and since it was two or three yards from the
other, Dick got up when she filled the cups. She gave
him two, which he carried back, but remained where
she was, within hearing but far enough away not to
obtrude her society upon the others. Dick, who
lighted his cigar, felt grateful to Fuller. It was some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
time since he had met people of any refinement on
friendly terms, and until he took up his quarters in
the locomotive shed had been living in squalor and
dirt.
</p>
<p>There was not much furniture outside the tent, but
the neat folding tables, comfortable canvas chairs, delicate
china, and silver coffee-pot gave the place a luxurious
look, and though Miss Fuller was, so to speak,
outside the circle, the presence of a well-dressed, attractive
girl had its charm. Indeed, Dick felt half
embarrassed by the pleasantness of his surroundings.
They were unusual and reminded him poignantly of
the privileges he had enjoyed in England.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you learn to make these calculations?&#8221;
Fuller asked after a time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the British Army, Royal Engineers,&#8221; Dick answered
with a flush.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you an officer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick had dreaded the question. It looked as if
truthfulness would cost him much; but he determined
that his new friends should know the worst.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why did you quit?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick glanced at Ida, and imagined that she was
interested, though she did not look up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was turned out, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Fuller, without surprise. &#8220;May I ask
why? It&#8217;s not impertinent curiosity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was sent with some important papers, which I
lost. This was bad enough, but there was some
ground for suspecting that I had stolen them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know how they were lost?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick was grateful for the way the question was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
put, since it hinted that Fuller did not doubt his honesty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is, I have a notion, but I&#8217;m
afraid I&#8217;ll never quite find out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Fuller did not reply for a minute or two, and Dick,
whose face was rather hot, glanced back at Ida. Her
eyes were now fixed on him with quiet interest, and
something in her expression indicated approval.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Fuller, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to give you a
chance of making good, because if you had done anything
crooked, you wouldn&#8217;t have told me that tale.
You&#8217;ll quit driving the locomotive and superintend on
a section of the dam. I&#8217;m not satisfied with the fellow
who&#8217;s now in charge. He&#8217;s friendly with the
dago sub-contractors and I suspect I&#8217;m being robbed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick&#8217;s eyes sparkled. His foot was on the ladder
that led to success; and he did not mean to stay at
the bottom. Moreover, it caused him an exhilarating
thrill to feel that he was trusted again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best, sir,&#8221; he said gratefully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well; you&#8217;ll begin to-morrow, and can use
the rooms behind the iron office shack. But there&#8217;s
something you have forgotten.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick looked at him with a puzzled air; and Fuller
laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t asked what I&#8217;m going to pay you
yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;To tell the truth, it didn&#8217;t seem
to matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Profession comes first?&#8221; Fuller suggested.
&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s right, but I&#8217;ve hired professional men,
engineering and medical experts, who charged pretty
high. Anyhow, here&#8217;s my offer&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>Dick was satisfied, as was Fuller. The latter was
often generous and would not have taken unfair advantage
of Dick&#8217;s necessity, but he did not object to
engaging a talented young man at something below
the market rate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;While I&#8217;m here you&#8217;ll come over twice a week to
report,&#8221; he resumed. &#8220;And now if there&#8217;s anything
you&#8217;d like to ask.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all, I owe you a dollar,&#8221; Dick remarked,
putting the money on the table. &#8220;The pay-clerk
wouldn&#8217;t take it, because he said it would mix up his
accounts. I&#8217;m glad to pay you back, but this doesn&#8217;t
cancel the debt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t a big risk. I thought you looked played
out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was played out and hungry. In fact, it took me
five minutes to make up my mind whether I&#8217;d pay the
agent who gave me your address his fee, because it
meant going without a meal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Fuller nodded. &#8220;Did you hesitate again, after you
knew you&#8217;d got the job?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did. When we were hustled on board the
steamer, there was nobody at the gangway for a few
moments and I felt I wanted to run away. There
didn&#8217;t seem to be any reason for this, but I very nearly
went.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That kind of thing&#8217;s not quite unusual,&#8221; Fuller
answered with a smile. &#8220;In my early days, when
every dollar was of consequence, I often had a bad
time after I&#8217;d made a risky deal. Used to think I&#8217;d
been a fool, and I&#8217;d be glad to pay a smart fine if the
other party would let me out. Yet if he&#8217;d made the
proposition, I wouldn&#8217;t have clinched with it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Such vacillation doesn&#8217;t seem logical, in a man,&#8221;
Ida interposed. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you practical people rather
pride yourselves on being free from our complexities?
Still I suppose there is an explanation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a philosopher,&#8221; Fuller replied. &#8220;If you
have the constructive faculty, it&#8217;s your business to
make things and not examine your feelings; but my
explanation&#8217;s something like this&mdash;When you take a
big risk you have a kind of unconscious judgment
that tells you if you&#8217;re right, but human nature&#8217;s
weak, and scares you really don&#8217;t believe in begin
to grip. Then it depends on your nerve whether you
make good or not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t they call it sub-conscious?&#8221; Ida asked.
&#8220;And how does that judgment come?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s built up on past experience, on things
you&#8217;ve learned long since and stored away. In a
sense, they&#8217;re done with, you don&#8217;t call them up
and argue from them; but all the same, they&#8217;re the
driving force when you set your teeth and go
ahead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ida looked at Dick. &#8220;That can&#8217;t apply to us, who
have no long experience to fall back upon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve only made one venture of the kind, but I&#8217;ve
just discovered that it turned out right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Fuller smiled. &#8220;That&#8217;s neat.&#8221; Then he turned
to Ida. &#8220;But I wasn&#8217;t talking about women. They
don&#8217;t need experience.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes you&#8217;re merely smart, and sometimes
you&#8217;re rather deep, but I can&#8217;t decide which you are
just now,&#8221; Ida rejoined. &#8220;However, I expect you&#8217;re
longing to get back to the plans.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Fuller. &#8220;They have to be thought of,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
but life isn&#8217;t all a matter of building dams. Now I&#8217;m
getting old, I&#8217;ve found that out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you? Have you any opinion on the subject?&#8221;
Ida asked Dick.
</p>
<p>Dick hesitated, wondering whether she meant to
put him at his ease or was amused by his seriousness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t imagine my views are worth much and
they&#8217;re not very clear. In a way, of course, it&#8217;s plain
that Mr. Fuller&#8217;s right&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But after all, building dams and removing rocks
may very well come first?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick pondered this. So far, his profession had
certainly come first. He was not a prig or a recluse,
but he found engineering more interesting than people.
Now he came to think of it, he had been proud
of Helen&#8217;s beauty, but she had not stirred him much
or occupied all his thoughts. Indeed, he had only
once been overwhelmingly conscious of a woman&#8217;s
charm, and that was in Kenwardine&#8217;s garden. He
had lost his senses then, but did not mean to let anything
of the kind happen again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said diffidently, &#8220;so long as you&#8217;re content
with your occupation, it doesn&#8217;t seem necessary
to make experiments and look for adventures. I expect
it saves you trouble to stick to what you like and
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He noted Ida&#8217;s smile, and was silent afterwards
while she argued with her father. He did not want
to obtrude himself, and since they seemed to expect
him to stay, it was pleasant enough to sit and listen.
</p>
<p>The air was getting cooler and the moon had risen
and cast a silver track across the sea. The distant
rumble of the surf came up the hillside in a faint,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
rhythmic beat, and the peaks above the camp had
grown in distinctness. A smell of spice drifted out
of the jungle, and Dick, who was tired, was sensible
of a delightful languor. The future had suddenly
grown bright and besides this, Ida&#8217;s gracious friendliness
had given him back his confidence and self-respect.
He was no longer an outcast; he had his chance
of making good and regaining the amenities of life
that he had learned to value by their loss. He was
very grateful to the girl and Fuller, but at length took
his leave and returned to the locomotive shed with a
light heart and a springy step.
</p>
<p>Next morning he began his new work with keen
energy. It absorbed him, and as the dam slowly rose
in a symmetrical curve of molded stone, its austere
beauty commanded his attention. Hitherto he had
given utility the leading place, but a change had begun
the night he sat beneath the copper-beech with Clare
Kenwardine. The design of the structure was good,
but Dick determined that the work should be better,
and sometimes stopped in the midst of his eager activity
to note the fine, sweeping lines and silvery-gray
luster of the concrete blocks. There were soft lights
at dawn and when the sun sank in which the long embankment
glimmered as if carved in mother-of-pearl.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, he went to Fuller&#8217;s tent twice a
week and generally met Ida there. Once or twice, he
pleaded with his employer for extra labor and cement
to add some grace of outline to the dam, and, although
this was unproductive expenditure, Fuller agreed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I like a good job, but it&#8217;s going to cost high if
you mean to turn out a work of art,&#8221; he said. &#8220;However,
if Bethune thinks the notion all right, I suppose
I&#8217;ll have to consent.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>Dick colored, and wondered whether he had been
given a hint, for Bethune was his superior and a man
of ability.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t object, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; Fuller replied with a twinkle.
&#8220;Still, if you hustle him too much, you&#8217;ll make him
tired.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick did not smile, because he did not know how
far it was wise to go, but he suspected that Bethune
had been tired before he came to the dam. The latter
was generally marked by an air of languid indifference,
and while his work was well done he seldom exceeded
his duty.
</p>
<p>Next evening Dick went to see Bethune and found
him lying in a hammock hung between the posts of
the veranda of his galvanized iron hut. A syphon
and a tall glass filled with wine in which a lump of ice
floated, stood on a table within his reach, and an open
book lay upside down upon the floor. He wore white
duck trousers, a green shirt of fine material, and a
red sash very neatly wound round his waist. His face
was sunburned, but the features were delicately cut
and his hands, which hung over the edge of the hammock,
were well cared for.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mix yourself a drink,&#8221; he said to Dick. &#8220;There&#8217;s
a glass and some ice in the bureau inside. Anyhow
my steward boy put some there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick, who went into the hut, came back with a grin.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a bit of wet blanket, but the ice has gone.
It seems to have run into your papers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll dry,&#8221; Bethune said tranquilly. &#8220;You had
better put some of the <i>gaseosa</i> in the wine; it&#8217;s sour
Spanish <i>tinto</i>. Then if you like to pick up the book,
I&#8217;ll read you some François Villon. There was red
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
blood in that fellow and it&#8217;s a pity he&#8217;s dead. You get
into touch with him better beside the Spanish Main
than you can in New York.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never heard of him, and perhaps I ought to explain&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What you came for? Then go ahead and ease
your mind. It&#8217;s business first with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It occurred to me that I had perhaps taken too
much upon myself now and then. You are my chief,
of course, and I don&#8217;t want to look pushing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That shows good taste,&#8221; Bethune remarked.
&#8220;But how are you going to get over the difficulty that
you <i>are</i> what you call pushing? Anyhow, I&#8217;m surprised
it did occur to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To tell the truth, it was something Fuller
said&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I imagined! Well, when you go too far I&#8217;ll
pull you up, but we needn&#8217;t bother about it in the
meantime. You were obviously born a hustler, but
you have an ingenuousness that disarms resentment.
In fact, you quite upset our views of the British character.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the feeling&#8217;s mutual,&#8221; Dick rejoined with a
grin. &#8220;You don&#8217;t harmonize with what I&#8217;ve seen of
Americans.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ours is a big country and we&#8217;ve room for different
types; but I come from Georgia and we haven&#8217;t all
learned to hustle yet in the South. That&#8217;s probably
why I&#8217;m here, when I could have had a much better
paid job.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick did not doubt this, because he had seen something
of the other&#8217;s mathematical powers. He was
not a fool at figures himself, but Bethune could solve
by a flash of genius problems that cost him laborious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
calculation. It was strange that such a man should
be content to make a very modest use of his talents.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you have met Miss Fuller,&#8221; Bethune
resumed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;She made things pleasant for
me when I first went to the tent. I like her very
much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Fuller has most of the New England virtues,
including a stern sense of her responsibility. I expect
you don&#8217;t know if she shares her father&#8217;s good
opinion of yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what Fuller&#8217;s opinion is,&#8221; Dick replied
awkwardly.
</p>
<p>Bethune laughed. &#8220;Well, he&#8217;s given you a good
job. But why I asked was this: if Miss Fuller&#8217;s
quite satisfied about you, she&#8217;ll probably put her maverick
brother in your charge. She came here not long
ago with the object of finding out if I was suited for
the post, and I imagined learned something about me
in a quiet way. It was a relief when she obviously decided
that I wasn&#8217;t the proper man. The girl has intelligence.
If she had asked me, I could have recommended
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know much about her brother?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve learned something. The lad&#8217;s a breakaway
from the sober Fuller type; and I think his views of
life rather agree with mine. However, perhaps we
had better let Miss Fuller tell you what she thinks fit.
And now would you like some François Villon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Dick firmly. &#8220;I want to see that Moran
turns out his gang at sunrise and must get back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pick me up the book, anyhow,&#8221; Bethune replied,
and laughed good-humoredly when Dick left him.

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>DICK UNDERTAKES A RESPONSIBILITY</h3>
</div>

<p>The glare of the big arc-lights flooded the broad,
white plaza when Dick crossed it on his way
to the Hotel Magellan. The inhabitants of Santa
Brigida had finished their evening meal and, as was
their custom, were taking the air and listening to
the military band. They were of many shades of
color and different styles of dress, for dark-skinned
peons in plain white cotton, chattering negroes, and
grave, blue-clad Chinamen mingled with the citizens
who claimed to spring from European stock. These,
however, for the most part, were by no means white,
and though some derived their sallow skin from Andalusian
and Catalan ancestors, others showed traces
of Carib origin.
</p>
<p>The men were marked by Southern grace; the
younger women had a dark, languorous beauty, and
although their dress was, as a rule, an out of date
copy of Parisian modes, their color taste was good,
and the creamy white and soft yellow became them
well. A number of the men wore white duck, with
black or red sashes and Panama hats, but some had
Spanish cloaks and Mexican sombreros.
</p>
<p>Flat-topped houses, colored white and pink and
lemon, with almost unbroken fronts, ran round the
square. A few had green lattices and handsome iron
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
gates to the arched entrances that ran like a tunnel
through the house, but many showed no opening except
a narrow slit of barred window. Santa Brigida
was old, and the part near the plaza had been built
four hundred years ago.
</p>
<p>Dick glanced carelessly at the crowd as he crossed
the square. He liked the music, and there was something
interesting and exotic in the play of moving
color, but his mind was on his work and he wondered
whether he would find a man he wanted at the hotel.
One could enter it by a Moorish arch that harmonized
with the Eastern style of its front; but this had been
added, and he went in by the older tunnel and across
the patio to the open-fronted American bar that occupied
a space between the balcony pillars.
</p>
<p>He did not find his man, and after ordering some
wine, lighted a cigarette and looked about while he
waited to see if the fellow would come in. One or two
steamship officers occupied a table close by, a Frenchman
was talking excitedly to a handsome Spanish
half-breed, and a fat, red-faced German with spectacles
sat opposite a big glass of pale-colored beer.
Dick was not interested in these, but his glance grew
keener as it rested on a Spaniard, who had a contract
at the irrigation works, sitting with one of Fuller&#8217;s
storekeepers at the other end of the room. Though
there was no reason the Spaniard should not meet the
man in town, Dick wondered what they were talking
about, particularly since they had chosen a table away
from everybody else.
</p>
<p>The man he wanted did not come, and by and by
he determined to look for him in the hotel. He went
up an outside staircase from the patio, round which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
the building ran, and had reached a balcony when he
met Ida Fuller coming down. She stopped with a
smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am rather glad to see you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;My
father, who went on board the American boat, has
not come back as he promised, and the French lady
he left me with has gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going off to a cargo vessel to ask when they&#8217;ll
land our cement, and we might find out what is keeping
Mr. Fuller, if you don&#8217;t mind walking to the
mole.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They left the hotel and shortly afterwards reached
the mole, which sheltered the shallow harbor where
the cargo lighters were unloaded. The long, smooth
swell broke in flashes of green and gold phosphorescence
against the concrete wall, and the moon threw
a broad, glittering track across the sea. There was a
rattle of cranes and winches and a noisy tug was towing
a row of barges towards the land. The measured
thud of her engines broke through the splash of water
flung off the lighters&#8217; bows as they lurched across the
swell, and somebody on board was singing a Spanish
song. Farther out, a mailboat&#8217;s gently swaying hull
blazed with electric light, and astern of her the reflection
of a tramp steamer&#8217;s cargo lamp quivered
upon the sea. By and by, Dick, who ascertained that
Fuller had not landed, hailed a steam launch, which
came panting towards some steps.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can put you on board the American boat, and
bring you back if Mr. Fuller isn&#8217;t there,&#8221; he said, and
when Ida agreed, helped her into the launch.
</p>
<p>Then he took the helm while the fireman started
the engine, and the craft went noisily down the harbor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
As they passed the end of the mole, Dick
changed his course, and the white town rose clear to
view in the moonlight behind the sparkling fringe of
surf. The flat-topped houses rose in tiers up a gentle
slope, interspersed with feathery tufts of green and
draped here and there with masses of creepers. Narrow
gaps of shadow opened between them, and the
slender square towers of the cathedral dominated all,
but in places a steep, red roof struck a picturesque but
foreign note.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Santa Brigida has a romantic look at night,&#8221; Dick
remarked. &#8220;Somehow it reminds me of pictures of
the East.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is not very strange,&#8221; Ida answered with a
smile. &#8220;The flat roof and straight, unbroken wall
is the oldest type of architecture. Man naturally
adopted it when he gave up the tent and began to
build.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;Two uprights and a beam
across! You couldn&#8217;t get anything much simpler.
But how did it come here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Arabs found it in Palestine and took it to
Northern Africa as the Moslem conquest spread. The
cube, however, isn&#8217;t beautiful, and the Moors elaborated
it, as the Greeks had done, but in a different
way. The latter broke the square from the cornices
and pillars; the Moors with the Saracenic arch, minarets,
and fretted stone, and then forced their model
upon Spain. Still the primitive type survives longest
and the Spaniards brought that to the New World.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt, it&#8217;s the explanation. But the high,
red roofs yonder aren&#8217;t Moorish. The flat top would
suit the dry East, but these indicate a country where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
they need a pitch that will shed the rain and snow.
In fact one would imagine that the original model
came from Germany.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It really did. Spain was overrun by the Visigoths,
who were Teutons.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;this is interesting. I&#8217;m not
an architect, but construction&#8217;s my business, as well
as my hobby.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then don&#8217;t you think you are a fortunate man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a sense, perhaps,&#8221; Dick answered. &#8220;Still,
that&#8217;s no reason you should be bored for my entertainment.&#8221;
He paused and resumed: &#8220;I&#8217;m grateful because
you mean to be kind, as you were the night I
met you first at the tent. Although you had heard
my story, I saw you wanted to make me feel I was
being given a fresh start.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ida studied him with a thoughtful calm that he
found embarrassing. &#8220;Perhaps I did, but suppose
we talk about something else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. If it&#8217;s not bad form, I wasn&#8217;t in the
least astonished by your lecture about the roofs, because
one finds your people have a breadth of knowledge
that&#8217;s remarkable. I once showed an old abbey
near our place at home to some American tourists,
and soon saw they knew more about its history than
I did. There was a girl of seventeen who corrected
me once or twice, and when I went to the library I
found that she was right. The curious thing is that
you&#8217;re, so to speak, rather parochial with it all. One
of my American employers treated me pretty well
until he had to make some changes in his business.
Took me to his house now and then, and I found his
wife and daughters knew the old French and Italian
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
cities. Yet they thought them far behind Marlin
Bluff, which is really a horribly ugly place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; said Ida, laughing. &#8220;Still, the
physical attractiveness of a town isn&#8217;t it&#8217;s only charm.
Besides, are you sure you don&#8217;t mean patriotic when
you say parochial? You ought to sympathize with
the former feeling.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Patriotism is difficult when your
country has no use for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ida did not reply, and it was a few minutes later
when she said: &#8220;I&#8217;m glad I met you to-night, because
we go home soon and there&#8217;s a favor I want to
ask. My brother is coming out to take a post on
the irrigation work and I want you to look after
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But he mayn&#8217;t like being looked after, and it&#8217;s
very possible he knows more about the work than I
do. I&#8217;ve only had a military training.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jake has had no training at all, and is three or
four years younger than I think you are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, of course, I&#8217;ll be glad to teach him all I
can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t exactly what I mean, although we want
him to learn as much as possible about engineering.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what else I could teach him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ida smiled. &#8220;Then I must explain. Jake is rash
and fond of excitement and gay society. He makes
friends easily and trusts those he likes, but this has
some drawbacks because his confidence is often misplaced.
Now I don&#8217;t think you would find it difficult
to gain some influence over him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what would you expect me to do afterwards?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You might begin by trying to make him see how
interesting his new occupation is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That might be harder than you think,&#8221; Dick replied.
&#8220;Molding concrete and digging irrigation
ditches have a fascination for me, but I dare say it&#8217;s
an unusual taste. Your brother mightn&#8217;t like weighing
cement in the hot mixing sheds or dragging a
measuring chain about in the sun.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very possible,&#8221; Ida agreed with a hint of dryness.
&#8220;I want you to show him what it means; make
him feel the sense of power over material. Jake&#8217;s
rather boyish, and a boy loves to fire a gun because
something startling happens in obedience to his will
when he pulls the trigger. Isn&#8217;t it much the same
when one gives the orders that shatter massive rocks
and move ponderous stones? However, that&#8217;s not all.
I want you to keep him at the dam and prevent his
making undesirable friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Though it&#8217;s not the thing I&#8217;m cut out for, I&#8217;ll try,&#8221;
said Dick, with some hesitation. &#8220;I&#8217;m surprised that
you should put your brother in my charge, after what
you know about me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were unfortunate, negligent, perhaps, for
once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble is that my friends and relations
seemed to think me dishonest. At least, they believed
that my getting into disgrace was quite as bad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Ida calmly. &#8220;What I ask will
need some tact, but if you&#8217;ll promise to look after
Jake, I shall feel satisfied.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick was silent for the next few moments, watching
the phosphorescent foam stream back from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
launch&#8217;s bows. Then he said: &#8220;Thank you, Miss
Fuller. In a way, it&#8217;s embarrassing to feel you trust
me; but I&#8217;ll do what I can to deserve it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Three or four minutes afterwards the launch
steamed round the liner&#8217;s stern and ran into the gloom
beneath her tall side. There was a blaze of light
above that fell upon the farthest off of the row of
boats, past which the launch ran with her engine
stopped, and the dark water broke into a fiery sparkle
as the swell lapped the steamer&#8217;s plates. A man came
down the ladder when the launch jarred against its
foot, and Ida, finding that Fuller was still on board,
went up while Dick steamed across to the cargo-boat
that lay with winches hammering not far off. After
talking to her mate, he returned to the harbor, and
when he landed, lighted a cigarette and studied some
alterations that were being made at the landward end
of the mole. He had noticed the work as he passed
with Ida, but was now able to examine it. A number
of concrete blocks and cement bags were lying about.
</p>
<p>Beckoning a peon who seemed to be the watchman,
Dick gave him a cigarette and asked: &#8220;How far are
they going to re-face the mole?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As far as the post yonder, señor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was obvious that a large quantity of cement
would be required and Dick resumed: &#8220;Who is doing
the work?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don Ramon Oliva.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick hid his interest. Ramon Oliva was the man
he had seen talking to Fuller&#8217;s storekeeper at the hotel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where does one buy cement in this town?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Señor Vaz, the merchant, sells it now and then.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>Dick let the peon go, and leaving the mole, found
Vaz in a café. Sitting down at his table he asked:
&#8220;Do you keep cement in your warehouse?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes,&#8221; said the other; &#8220;when work it is
required for is going on. But I sold the last I had
two or three months ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe we run short now and then, but we have
a big lot being landed now. As our sheds will be
pretty full, I could let you have a quantity if you
like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, but no,&#8221; said the merchant. &#8220;I do not
think anybody would buy it from me for some time,
and it is bad to keep when one&#8217;s store is damp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick, who drank a glass of wine with him, went
away in a thoughtful mood. He wondered where
Don Ramon got his cement, and meant to find out,
though he saw that caution would be needed. He
owed much to Fuller and had made his master&#8217;s business
his. Now it looked as if Fuller were being
robbed and although he had, no doubt, cunning rogues
to deal with, Dick determined that the thing must
be stopped. When he returned to the dam he went to
Bethune&#8217;s hut and found him lying in his hammock.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whose duty is it to check the storekeeper&#8217;s lists?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;I suppose you strike a balance between
the goods delivered him and the stuff he hands out
for use on the works.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s done, of course,&#8221; said Bethune. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t
examined the books myself; François, the Creole
clerk, is responsible. However, one would imagine
you had duties enough without taking up another, but
if you mean to do so, you had better begin soon.
Your energy won&#8217;t stand this climate long.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I may do yet,&#8221; Dick replied.
&#8220;Still, it struck me that our stores might be sold in
the town.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect they are, to some extent,&#8221; Bethune carelessly
agreed. &#8220;That kind of thing is hard to stop
anywhere, and these folks are very smart at petty
pilfering. Anyway, you might get yourself into
trouble by interfering and any small theft you stopped
probably wouldn&#8217;t pay for the time you&#8217;d have to
spend on the job. Leave it alone, and take matters
as you find them, is my advice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick talked about something else, but when he
went back to his shack he knew what he meant to do.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>AN INFORMAL COURT</h3>
</div>

<p>One morning, soon after Fuller and his daughter
had gone home, Dick stood at a table in the
testing house behind the mixing sheds. The small,
galvanized iron building shook with the throb of engines
and rattle of machinery, and now and then a
shower of cinders pattered upon the roof; for the big
mill that ground up the concrete was working across
the road. The lattice shutters were closed, for the
sake of privacy, and kept out the glare, though they
could not keep out the heat, which soaked through the
thin, iron walls, and Dick&#8217;s face was wet with perspiration
as he arranged a number of small concrete blocks.
Some of these were broken, and some partly crushed.
Delicate scales and glass measures occupied a neighboring
shelf, and a big steel apparatus that looked
rather like a lever weighing machine stood in the
shadow.
</p>
<p>Where the draught that came through the lattices
flowed across the room, Bethune lounged in a canvas
chair, and another man, with a quiet, sunburned face,
sat behind him. This was Stuyvesant, whose authority
was only second to Fuller&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Brandon seems to have taken a good deal of
trouble, but this kind of investigation needs the strictest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
accuracy, and we haven&#8217;t the best of testing apparatus,&#8221;
Bethune remarked. &#8220;I expect he&#8217;ll allow
that the results he has got may be to some extent misleading,
and I doubt if it&#8217;s worth while to go on with
the matter. Are you sure you have made no mistakes,
Dick?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick pondered for a few moments. If he were
right, as he thought he was, the statements he had to
make would lead to the discharge of the sub-contractor.
Remembering his own disgrace, he shrank
from condemning another. He knew what he had
suffered, and the man might be innocent although his
guilt seemed plain. It was a hateful situation, but
his duty was to protect his master&#8217;s interests and he
could not see him robbed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can check my calculations,&#8221; he answered
quietly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; agreed Stuyvesant, who added with a
dry smile as he noted Bethune&#8217;s disapproving look:
&#8220;We can decide about going on with the thing when
we have heard Brandon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Dick, giving him some papers,
and then indicated two different rows of the small
concrete blocks. &#8220;These marked A were made from
cement in our store; the lot B from some I took from
Oliva&#8217;s stock on the mole. They were subjected to
the same compressive, shearing, and absorbent tests,
and you&#8217;ll see that there&#8217;s very little difference in the
results. The quality of standard makes of cement is,
no doubt, much alike, but you wouldn&#8217;t expect to find
that of two different brands identical. My contention
is that the blocks were made from the same stuff.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stuyvesant crossed the floor and measured the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
blocks with a micrometer gage, after which he filled
two of the graduated glass measures and then weighed
the water.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he said to Bethune, who had picked up
Dick&#8217;s calculations.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The figures are right; he&#8217;s only out in a small
decimal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stuyvesant took the papers and compared them with
a printed form he produced from his pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They correspond with the tests the maker claims
his stuff will stand, and we can take it that they&#8217;re accurate.
Still, this doesn&#8217;t prove that Oliva stole the
cement from us. The particular make is popular on
this coast, and he may have bought a quantity from
somebody else. Did you examine the bags on the
mole, Brandon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;I had to get my samples in
the dark. If Oliva bought the cement, he must have
kept it for some time, because the only man in the
town who stocks it sold the last he had three months
ago. The next thing is our storekeeper&#8217;s tally showing
the number of bags delivered to him. I sat up
half the night trying to balance this against what he
handed out and could make nothing of the entries.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see,&#8221; said Bethune, and lighted a cigarette
when Dick handed him a book, and a bundle of small,
numbered forms. &#8220;You can talk, if you like,&#8221; he
added as he sharpened a pencil.
</p>
<p>Dick moved restlessly up and down the floor, examining
the testing apparatus, but he said nothing,
and Stuyvesant did not speak. He was a reserved
and thoughtful man. After a time, Bethune threw
the papers on the table.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></p>
<p>&#8220;François isn&#8217;t much of a bookkeeper,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;One or two of the delivery slips have been
entered twice, and at first I suspected he might have
conspired with Oliva. Still, that&#8217;s against my notion
of his character, and I find he&#8217;s missed booking stuff
that had been given out, which, of course, wouldn&#8217;t
have suited the other&#8217;s plans.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can generally count on a Frenchman&#8217;s honesty,&#8221;
Stuyvesant observed. &#8220;But do you make the
deliveries ex-store tally with what went in?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Bethune dryly. &#8220;Here&#8217;s the balance
I struck. It shows the storekeeper is a good
many bags short.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He passed the paper across, and Dick examined it
with surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have worked this out already from the muddled
and blotted entries! Do you think you&#8217;ve got it
right?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; said Bethune, smiling. &#8220;I&#8217;ll prove it
if you like. We know how much cement went into
stock. How many molded blocks of the top course
have we put down at the dam?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick told him, and after a few minutes&#8217; calculation
Bethune looked up. &#8220;Then here you are! Our concrete&#8217;s
a standard density; we know the weight of
water and sand and what to allow for evaporation.
You see my figures agree very closely with the total
delivery ex-store.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They did so, and Dick no longer wondered how
Bethune, who ostentatiously declined to let his work
interfere with his comfort, held his post. The man
thought in numbers, using the figures, as one used
words, to express his knowledge rather than as a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
means of obtaining it by calculation. Dick imagined
this was genius.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Stuyvesant, &#8220;I guess we had better
send for the storekeeper next.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get it over,&#8221; agreed Bethune. &#8220;It&#8217;s an unpleasant
job.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick sent a half-naked peon to look for the man,
and was sensible of some nervous strain as he waited
for his return. He hated the task he had undertaken,
but it must be carried out. Bethune, who had at
first tried to discourage him, now looked interested,
and Dick saw that Stuyvesant was resolute. In the
meanwhile, the shed had grown suffocatingly hot, his
face and hands were wet with perspiration, and the
rumble of machinery made his head ache. He lighted
a cigarette, but the tobacco tasted bitter and he threw
it away. Then there were footsteps outside and
Stuyvesant turned to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We leave you to put the thing through. You&#8217;re
prosecutor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick braced himself as a man came in and stood
by the table, looking at the others suspiciously. He
was an American, but his face was heavy and rather
sullen, and his white clothes were smeared with dust.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been examining your stock-book,&#8221; said
Dick. &#8220;It&#8217;s badly kept.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The fellow gave him a quick glance. &#8220;Mr. Fuller
knows I&#8217;m not smart at figuring, and if you want
the books neat, you&#8217;ll have to get me a better clerk.
Anyhow, I&#8217;ve my own tally and allow I can tell you
what stuff I get and where it goes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is satisfactory. Look at this list and tell
me where the cement you&#8217;re short of has gone.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Into the mixing shed, I guess,&#8221; said the other
with a half-defiant frown.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it didn&#8217;t come out. We haven&#8217;t got the concrete
at the dam. Are there any full bags not accounted
for in the shed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. You ought to know the bags are skipped
right into the tank as the mill grinds up the mush.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. Perhaps you&#8217;d better consult your
private tally and see if it throws any light upon the
matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man took out a note-book and while he studied
it Bethune asked, &#8220;Will you let me have the book?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess not,&#8221; said the other, who shut the book
with a snap, and then turned and confronted Dick.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to know why you&#8217;re getting after me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fairly plain. You&#8217;re responsible for the stores
and can&#8217;t tell us what has become of a quantity of the
goods.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose I own up that my tally&#8217;s got mixed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;d show yourself unfit for your job; but
that is not the worst. If you had made a mistake
the bags wouldn&#8217;t vanish. You had the cement, it
isn&#8217;t in the store and hasn&#8217;t reached us in the form
of concrete. It must have gone somewhere.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you reckon it went, if it wasn&#8217;t into the
mixing shed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To the Santa Brigida mole,&#8221; Dick answered
quietly, and noting the man&#8217;s abrupt movement, went
on: &#8220;What were you talking to Ramon Oliva about
at the Hotel Magellan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The storekeeper did not reply, but the anger and
confusion in his face were plain, and Dick turned to
the others.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;ll send for Oliva,&#8221; said Stuyvesant.
&#8220;Keep this fellow here until he comes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Oliva entered tranquilly, though his black eyes got
very keen when he glanced at his sullen accomplice.
He was picturesquely dressed, with a black silk sash
round his waist and a big Mexican sombrero. Taking
out a cigarette, he remarked that it was unusually hot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are doing some work on the town mole,&#8221;
Dick said to him. &#8220;Where did you get the cement?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I bought it,&#8221; Oliva answered, with a surprised
look.
</p>
<p>&#8220;From whom?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A merchant at Anagas, down the coast. But,
señores, my contract on the mole is a matter for the
port officials. I do not see the object of these questions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better answer them,&#8221; Stuyvesant remarked,
and signed Dick to go on.
</p>
<p>Dick paused for a moment or two, remembering
how he had confronted his judges in a tent in an English
valley. The scene came back with poignant distinctness.
</p>
<p>He could hear the river brawling among the stones,
and feel his Colonel&#8217;s stern, condemning gaze fixed
upon his face. For all that, his tone was resolute
as he asked: &#8220;What was the brand of the cement
you bought?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The <i>Tenax</i>, señor,&#8221; Oliva answered with a defiant
smile.
</p>
<p>Then Dick turned to the others with a gesture which
implied that there was no more to be said, and quietly
sat down. <i>Tenax</i> was not the brand that Fuller used,
and its different properties would have appeared in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
the tests. The sub-contractor had betrayed himself
by the lie, and his accomplice looked at him with disgust.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve given the thing away,&#8221; he growled.
&#8220;Think they don&#8217;t know what cement is? Now they
have you fixed!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was silence for the next minute while Stuyvesant
studied some figures in his pocket-book. Then
he wrote upon a leaf, which he tore out and told Dick
to give it to Oliva.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a rough statement of your account up to
the end of last month, Don Ramon,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You
can check it and afterwards hand the pay-clerk a formal
bill, brought up to date, but you&#8217;ll notice I have
charged you with a quantity of cement that&#8217;s missing
from our store. Your engagement with Mr. Fuller
ends to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Oliva spread out his hands with a dramatic gesture.
&#8220;Señores, this is a scandal, a grand injustice! You
understand it will ruin me? It is impossible that I
submit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. We&#8217;ll put the matter into the hands
of the <i>Justicia</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is equal,&#8221; Oliva declared with passion. &#8220;You
have me marked as a thief. The port officials give
me no more work and my friends talk. At the <i>Justicia</i>
all the world hears my defense.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As you like,&#8221; said Stuyvesant, but the storekeeper
turned to Oliva with a contemptuous grin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I allow you&#8217;re not such a blamed fool,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;Take the chance they&#8217;ve given you and
get from under before the roof falls in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Oliva pondered for a few moments, his eyes fixed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
on Stuyvesant&#8217;s unmoved face, and then shrugged with
an air of injured resignation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a grand scandal, but I make my bill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He moved slowly to the door, but paused as he
reached it, and gave Dick a quick, malignant glance.
Then he went out and the storekeeper asked Stuyvesant:
&#8220;What are you going to do with me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fire you right now. Go along to the pay-clerk
and give him your time. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s all
we ought to do; but we&#8217;ll be satisfied if you and your
partner get off this camp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll quit,&#8221; said the storekeeper, who turned to
Dick. &#8220;You&#8217;re a smart kid, but we&#8217;d have bluffed
you all right if the fool had allowed he used the same
cement.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then he followed Oliva, and Stuyvesant got up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was Oliva&#8217;s mistake,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;I saw
where you were leading him and you put the questions
well. Now, however, you&#8217;ll have to take on his duties
until we get another man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They left the testing-house, and as Bethune and
Dick walked up the valley the former said: &#8220;It&#8217;s my
opinion that you were imprudent in one respect. You
showed the fellows that it was you who found them
out. It might have been better if you had, so to speak,
divided the responsibility.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve gone, and that&#8217;s the most important
thing,&#8221; Dick rejoined.
</p>
<p>&#8220;From the works. It doesn&#8217;t follow that they&#8217;ll
quit Santa Brigida. Payne, the storekeeper, is of
course an American tough, but I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll make
trouble. He&#8217;d have robbed us cheerfully, but I expect
he&#8217;ll take his being found out as a risk of the game;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
besides, Stuyvesant will have to ship him home if he
asks for his passage. But I didn&#8217;t like the look Oliva
gave you. These dago half-breeds are a revengeful
lot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not in the town often and I&#8217;ll be careful if
I go there after dark. To tell the truth, I didn&#8217;t want
to interfere, but I couldn&#8217;t let the rogues go on with
their stealing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose not,&#8221; Bethune agreed. &#8220;The trouble
about doing your duty is that it often costs you something.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>JAKE FULLER</h3>
</div>

<p>A month after Fuller sailed his son arrived at
Santa Brigida, and Dick, who met him on the
mole, got something of a surprise when a handsome
youth landed and came straight towards him. Jake
Fuller was obviously very young, but had an ease of
manner and a calm self-confidence that would have
done credit to an elderly man of the world. His
clothes showed nice taste, and there was nothing about
him to indicate the reckless scapegrace Dick had expected.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re Brandon, of course,&#8221; he said as he shook
hands. &#8220;Glad to meet you. Knew you a quarter
of a mile off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221; Dick asked. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t seen
me before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For one thing, you&#8217;re stamped Britisher; then you
had a kind of determined look, as if you&#8217;d come down
to yank me right off to the irrigation ditches before
I&#8217;d time to run loose in the city. Matter of duty to
you, and you were going to put it through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick said nothing, and Jake laughed. &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s
all right; I guess we&#8217;ll hit it! And now we&#8217;ll put out
when you like. I laid in a pretty good breakfast on
the boat; I like smart service and a well-chosen menu,
and don&#8217;t suppose you have either at the camp.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They might be better,&#8221; Dick agreed, feeling that
he had promised Miss Fuller more than he might be
able to perform. Then he told a peon to take Jake&#8217;s
luggage and led the way to a mule carriage at the end
of the mole.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect to ride in a transfer-wagon,&#8221; Jake
remarked. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t you any autos yet? If not,
I&#8217;ll indent for one when the next stock order goes
home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you had better wait until you see the
roads.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re surely British,&#8221; Jake replied. &#8220;If you&#8217;d
been an American, you&#8217;d get the car first and make
the roads fit in. However, you might tell the ancient
dago to get a move on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick was silent for the next few minutes. On the
whole, he thought he would like Fuller, and made
some allowance for the excitement he, no doubt, felt
at beginning his career in a foreign country, but none
for any wish to impress his companion. It was unlikely
that the self-possessed lad would care what Dick
thought of him, although it looked as if he meant to
be friendly. Then as the sweating mules slowly
climbed the rutted track out of the town Dick began
to point out the changing level of the land, the ravines,
or barrancos, that formed natural drainage channels
from the high watershed, and the influence of drought
and moisture on the cultivation. Jake showed a polite
interest, but inquired what amusements were to be
had in Santa Brigida, about which Dick gave him as
little information as possible. If he had understood
Miss Fuller&#8217;s hints, the Spanish city was no place for
her brother.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>Jake spent the day following Dick about the works
and made no complaint about the heat and dust, though
he frowned when a shower of cement or a splash of
oil fell upon his clothes. It was obvious that he knew
nothing about engineering, but the questions he asked
indicated keen intelligence and Dick was satisfied. A
room adjoining the latter&#8217;s quarters had been prepared
for the newcomer, and they sat, smoking, on the veranda
after the evening meal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think you&#8217;ll like your work?&#8221; Dick asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to like it, and it might be worse. Since
I&#8217;m not allowed to draw or model things, I can make
them, and I guess that&#8217;s another form of the same
talent, though it&#8217;s considerably less interesting than
the first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But perhaps more useful,&#8221; Dick suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know. Our taste is pretty barbarous,
as a rule, and you can&#8217;t claim that yours is
more advanced, but I allow that the Spaniards who
built Santa Brigida had an eye for line and color.
These dagos have a gift we lack; you can see it in
the way they wear their clothes. My notion is that
it&#8217;s some use to teach your countrymen to admire
beauty and grace. We&#8217;re great at making things, but
there&#8217;s no particular need to make them ugly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re a bit of an artist?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I meant to be a whole one and might have made
good, although the old man has not much use for art.
Unfortunately, however, I felt I had to kick against
the conventionality of the life I led and the protest
I put up was a little too vigorous. It made trouble,
and in consequence, my folks decided I&#8217;d better be an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
engineer. I couldn&#8217;t follow their arguments, but had
to acquiesce.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s curious how you artists claim to be exempt
from the usual rules, as if you were different from the
rest of us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We <i>are</i> different,&#8221; Jake rejoined with a twinkle.
&#8220;It&#8217;s our business to see the truth of things, while
you try to make it fit your formulas about what you
think is most useful to yourself or society. A formula&#8217;s
like bad spectacles; it distorts the sight, and
yours is plainly out of focus. For example, I guess
you&#8217;re satisfied with the white clothes you&#8217;re wearing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s important, but what&#8217;s the
matter with them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jake, with a critical glance, &#8220;they&#8217;re
all wrong. Now you&#8217;ve got good shoulders, your
figure&#8217;s well balanced, and I like the way you hold
your head, but your tailor has spoiled every prominent
line. I&#8217;ll show you some time when I model
you in clay.&#8221; He paused and grinned. &#8220;I guess
the Roman sentinel pose would suit you best, as I
noted it when you stood on the mole waiting for me,
determined to do your duty at any cost. Besides,
there is something of the soldier about you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d stop rotting,&#8221; said Dick with a touch
of awkwardness, though he saw that Jake knew nothing
about his leaving the army. &#8220;Was it your father&#8217;s
notion that you should be an engineer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He thinks so,&#8221; Jake answered, grinning. &#8220;My
opinion is that you have to thank my sister Ida for
the job of looking after me. She made this her business
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
until I went to Yale, when, of course, she lost
control. Ida has a weakness for managing people,
for their good, but you ought to take it as a delicate
compliment that she passed me on to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;After all, Miss Fuller&#8217;s age must be nearly the
same as mine,&#8221; Dick remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see what you mean, but in some respects she&#8217;s
much older. In fact, I guess I could give you a year
or two myself. But it seems to me you&#8217;ve kind of
wilted since we began to talk. You&#8217;ve gone slack and
your eyes look heavy. Say, I&#8217;m sorry if I&#8217;ve made
you tired.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you had much to do with it,&#8221; said
Dick. &#8220;My head aches and I&#8217;ve a shivery feeling
that came on about this time last night. A touch of
malarial fever, perhaps; they get it now and then in
the town, though we ought to be free from it on the
hill. Anyhow, if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;ll get off to bed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went away, and Jake looked about the veranda
and the room that opened on to it. There was a
canvas chair or two, a folding table, a large drawing
board on a trestle frame, and two cheap, tin lamps.
It was obvious that Dick thought of nothing much
except his work and had a Spartan disregard for comfort.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A good sort, but it&#8217;s concrete first and last with
him,&#8221; Jake remarked. &#8220;Guess I&#8217;ve got to start by
making this shack fit for a white man to live in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick passed a restless night, but felt better when
he began his work on the dam next morning, though
he did not touch the small hard roll and black coffee
his colored steward had put ready for him. The air
was fresh, the jungle that rolled down the hill glittered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
with dew, and the rays of the red sun had, so
far, only a pleasant warmth. Cranes were rattling,
locomotives snorted as they moved the ponderous concrete
blocks and hauled away loads of earth, and a
crowd of picturesque figures were busy about the dam.
Some wore dirty white cotton and ragged crimson
sashes; the dark limbs of others projected from garments
of vivid color. Dick drove the men as hard
as he was able. They worked well, chattering and
laughing, in the early morning, and there was much
to be done, because Oliva&#8217;s dismissal had made a difference.
</p>
<p>The men flagged, as the sun got higher, and at
length Dick sat down in the thin shade of a tree. The
light was now intense, the curving dam gleamed a
dazzling pearly-gray through a quivering radiance,
and the water that had gathered behind it shone like
molten silver. One could imagine that the pools reflected
heat as well as light. Dick&#8217;s eyes ached, and
for a few minutes he let them rest upon the glossy,
green jungle, and the belts of cultivation down the
hill.
</p>
<p>Then he roused himself, because he must watch
what was going on. The great blocks must be properly
fitted into place, and one could not trust the dusky
laborers to use the care that was needed; besides, they
were getting slack, and the fresh blocks the locomotives
brought would soon begin to accumulate. Since
this would mean extra handling and consequent expense,
the track must be kept clear. Still, Dick
wished noon would come, for his head ached badly
and he felt the heat as he had not felt it before.
</p>
<p>It was hard to force himself to begin again after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
the short mid-day rest, but he became a little more
vigorous as the sun sank and the shadow of the black
cordillera lengthened across the valley. After dinner,
when he lounged on the veranda, the headache and
lassitude returned, and he listened to Jake&#8217;s talk vacantly
and soon went to bed. He knew he was not
well, but while malarial fever was not unusual in the
neighborhood people seldom took it in a virulent form,
and as there was a good doctor at Santa Brigida he
determined to consult him when he had occasion to
visit the town. As it happened, a crane broke next
day, and when evening came he set off to inquire if
new castings could be made for it in the Spanish
foundry. While he waited for an engine to take him
down the line, Jake announced his intention of coming.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been round a Spanish town,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going round a Spanish town now, if
I can prevent it,&#8221; Dick rejoined. &#8220;However, I suppose
I can&#8217;t order you off your father&#8217;s locomotive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake smiled. &#8220;You can resent my taking the line
you hint at when I&#8217;ve done so, but I guess one must
make allowances. You&#8217;re getting the fever badly,
partner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the heat,&#8221; Dick answered in an apologetic
tone. &#8220;Anyhow, Santa Brigida&#8217;s a dirty, uninteresting
place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect your ideas of what&#8217;s interesting are different
from mine. Concrete&#8217;s all right in the daytime,
though you can have too much of it then, but you
want to please your eye and relax your brain at night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was afraid of something of the kind. But
here&#8217;s the locomotive. Get up, if you&#8217;re coming.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>Dick was silent as the engine jolted down the track,
for he was feverish and his companion&#8217;s talk irritated
him. Besides, he had promised Ida Fuller to take
care of the lad and knew something of the license
that ruled in the city. Jake seemed to claim the supposititious
privileges of the artistic temperament, and
there were wine-shops, gamblers, pretty Creole girls
with easy manners, and ragged desperados who carried
knives, in Santa Brigida. In fact, it offered too
many opportunities for romantic adventures. In consequence,
Dick went to the Hotel Magellan, which
they reached after walking from the end of the line,
and took Jake into the bar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better stop here; I won&#8217;t be longer than
I can help,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;ll make you a rather
nice iced drink of Canary <i>tinto</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; Jake replied. &#8220;<i>Tinto&#8217;s</i> a thin, sour
claret, isn&#8217;t it? In New York not long ago you could
get iced buttermilk. Can&#8217;t say I was fond of it, but
I reckon it&#8217;s as exhilarating as the other stuff.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick left him with some misgivings and went about
his business. It was eight o&#8217;clock in the evening and
the foundry would be closed, but he knew where the
manager lived and went to his house, which was situated
in the older part of the city. He had not taken
Jake because he had to pass some of the less reputable
cafés and gambling dens and thought it undesirable
that the lad should know where they were. The
foundry manager was not at home, but a languishing
young woman with a thickly powdered face, who
called her mother before she conferred with Dick, told
him where Don Tomas had gone, and Dick set off
again in search of the café she named.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>A half moon hung low in the clear sky, but, for
the most part, its light only reached a short distance
down the white and yellow fronts of the flat-topped
houses. These got light and air from the central
courtyard, or patio, and the outer walls were only
pierced by one or two very narrow windows at some
height from the ground. The openings were marked
here and there by a faint glow from within, which
was often broken by a shadowy female form leaning
against the bars and speaking softly to another figure
on the pavement below.
</p>
<p>There were few street lamps, and in places the houses
crowded in upon the narrow strip of gloom through
which Dick picked his way with echoing steps. Most
of the citizens were in the plaza, and the streets were
quiet except for the measured beat of the surf and
the distant music of the band. A smell of rancid
oil and garlic, mingled with the strong perfumes Spanish
women use, hung about the buildings, but now
and then a puff of cooler air flowed through a dark
opening and brought with it the keen freshness of the
sea. Once the melancholy note of a guitar came down
from a roof and somebody began to sing in a voice
that quivered with fantastic tremolos.
</p>
<p>Dick went carefully, keeping as far as possible away
from the walls. In Santa Brigida, all white men were
supposed to be rich, and the honesty of the darker
part of its mixed population was open to doubt. Besides,
he had learned that the fair-skinned Northerners
were disliked. They brought money, which
was needed, into the country, but they also brought
machines and business methods that threatened to disturb
the tranquillity the Latin half-breed enjoyed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
The latter must be beaten in industrial strife and, exchanging
independence for higher wages, become subject
to a more vigorous, mercantile race. The half-breeds
seemed to know this, and regarded the foreigners
with jealous eyes. For all that, Dick carried
no weapons. A pistol large enough to be of use was
an awkward thing to hide, and he agreed with Bethune
that to wear it ostentatiously was more likely to provoke
than avoid attack.
</p>
<p>Once he thought he was followed, but when he
stopped to look round, the shadowy figure behind
turned into a side street, and he presently found the
man he was in search of in a quiet café. He spent
some time explaining the drawings of the patterns
that would be required before Don Tomas undertook
to make the castings, and then languidly leaned back
in his chair. His head had begun to ache again and
he felt strangely limp and tired. The fever was returning,
as it did at night, but he roused himself by
and by and set off to visit the doctor.
</p>
<p>On his way he passed the casino and, to his surprise,
saw Jake coming down the steps. Dick frowned
when they met.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you get in?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;It&#8217;s the rule
for somebody to put your name down on your first
visit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So it seemed,&#8221; said Jake. &#8220;There are, however,
ways of getting over such difficulties, and a dollar
goes some distance in this country; much farther, in
fact, than it does in ours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s some consolation to think you&#8217;ve had to pay
for your amusement,&#8221; Dick answered sourly.
</p>
<p>Jake smiled. &#8220;On the contrary, I found it profitable.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
You make a mistake that&#8217;s common with serious
folks, by taking it for granted that a cheerful character
marks a fool.&#8221; He put his hand in his pocket and
brought it out filled with silver coin. &#8220;Say, what do
you think of this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Put the money back,&#8221; Dick said sharply, for there
was a second-rate wine-shop not far off and a group
of untidy half-breeds lounged about its front. Jake,
however, took out another handful of silver.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My luck was pretty good; I reckon it says something
for me that I knew when to stop.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He jingled the money as he passed the wine-shop,
and Dick, looking back, thought one of the men inside
got up, but nobody seemed to be following them
when they turned into another street. This was the
nearest way to the doctor&#8217;s, but it was dark and narrow,
and Dick did not like its look.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep in the middle,&#8221; he warned Jake.
</p>
<p>They were near the end of the street when two men
came out of an arch and waited for them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you a match, señor?&#8221; one who held a cigarette
in his hand asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Dick suspiciously. &#8220;Keep back!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is only a match we want,&#8221; said the other,
and Jake stopped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with giving him one? Wait
till I get my box.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He gave it to the fellow, who struck a match, and
after lighting his cigarette held it so that the faint
illumination touched Dick&#8217;s face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, señor,&#8221; said the half-breed, who turned
to his companion as he added softly in Castilian:
&#8220;The other.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>Dick understood. It was not Jake but himself who
was threatened; and he thought he knew why.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out for that fellow, Jake!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Get
back to the wall!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake, to Dick&#8217;s relief, did as he was told, but next
moment another man ran out of the arch, and somebody
in the darkness called out in Castilian. Dick
thought he knew the voice; but the men were behind
him now, and he turned to face them. The nearest
had his hand at his ragged sash, and Dick saw that
he must act before the long Spanish knife came out.
He struck hard, leaning forward as he did so, and
the man reeled back; but the other two closed with
him, and although his knuckles jarred as a second
blow got home, he felt a stinging pain high up in
his side. His breathing suddenly got difficult, but
as he staggered towards the wall he saw Jake dash his
soft hat in the face of another antagonist and spring
upon the fellow. There seemed to be four men round
them and one was like Oliva, the contractor; but
Dick&#8217;s sight was going and he had a fit of coughing
that was horribly painful.
</p>
<p>He heard Jake shout and footsteps farther up the
street, and tried to lean against the house for support,
but slipped and fell upon the pavement. He could
neither see nor hear well, but made out that his assailants
had slunk away and men were running towards
Jake, who stood, calling for help, in the middle
of the street. Shortly afterwards a group of dark
figures gathered round and he heard confused voices.
He thought Jake knelt down and tried to lift him,
but this brought on a stab of burning pain and he
knew nothing more.

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>LA MIGNONNE</h3>
</div>

<p>A cool sea breeze blew through the half-opened
lattice, and a ray of sunshine quivered upon
the ocher-colored wall, when Dick awoke from a
refreshing sleep. He felt helplessly weak, and his
side, which was covered by a stiff bandage, hurt him
when he moved, but his head was clear at last and he
languidly looked about. The room was spacious, but
rather bare. There was no carpet, but a rug made
a blotch of cool green on the smooth, dark floor.
Two or three religious pictures hung upon the wall
and he noted how the soft blue of the virgin&#8217;s dress
harmonized with the yellow background. An arch
at one end was covered by a leather curtain like those
in old Spanish churches, but it had been partly drawn
back to let the air circulate. Outside the hooked-back
lattice he saw the rails of a balcony, and across
the narrow patio a purple creeper spread about a dazzling
white wall.
</p>
<p>All this was vaguely familiar, because it was some
days since Dick had recovered partial consciousness,
though he had been too feeble to notice his surroundings
much or find out where he was. Now he studied
the room with languid interest as he tried to remember
what had led to his being brought there. The
scanty furniture was dark and old; and he knew the
wrinkled, brown-faced woman in black who sat by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
window with a dark shawl wound round her head.
She had a place in his confused memories; as had
another woman with a curious lifeless face and an unusual
dress, who had once or twice lifted him and
done something to his bandages. Still, it was not of
her Dick was thinking. There had been somebody
else, brighter and fresher than either, who sat beside
him when he lay in fevered pain and sometimes stole
in and vanished after a pitiful glance.
</p>
<p>A bunch of flowers stood upon the table; and their
scent mingled with the faint smell of decay that hung
about the room. Lying still, Dick heard the leather
curtain rustle softly in the draught, muffled sounds
of traffic, and the drowsy murmur of the surf. Its
rhythmic beat was soothing and he thought he could
smell the sea. By and by he made an abrupt move
that hurt him as a voice floated into the room. It
was singularly clear and sweet, and he thought he
knew it, as he seemed to know the song, but could
not catch the words and the singing stopped. Then
light footsteps passed the arch and there was silence
again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that?&#8221; he asked with an energy he had not
been capable of until then.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>La mignonne</i>,&#8221; said the old woman with a smile
that showed her thick, red lips and firm white teeth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And who&#8217;s Mignonne?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>La, la!</i>&#8221; said the woman soothingly. &#8220;<i>C&#8217;est ma
mignonne.</i> But you jess go to sleep again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I go to sleep when I&#8217;m not sleepy and
you won&#8217;t tell me what I want to know?&#8221; Dick
grumbled, but the woman raised her hand and began
to sing an old plantation song.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a child,&#8221; he protested weakly. &#8220;But
that&#8217;s rather nice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Closing his eyes, he tried to think. His nurse was
not a Spanish mulatto, as her dark dress suggested.
It was more likely that she came from Louisiana,
where the old French stock had not died out; but
Dick felt puzzled. She had spoken, obviously with
affection, of <i>ma mignonne</i>; but he was sure the singer
was no child of hers. There was no Creole accent
in that clear voice, and the steps he heard were light.
The feet that had passed his door were small and
arched; not flat like a negro&#8217;s. He had seen feet of
the former kind slip on an iron staircase and brush,
in pretty satin shoes, across a lawn on which the moonlight
fell. Besides, a girl whose skin was fair and
whose movements were strangely graceful had flitted
about his room. While he puzzled over this he went
to sleep and on waking saw with a start of pleasure
Jake sitting near his bed. His nurse had gone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve come. There
are a lot of things I want to know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble is I&#8217;ve been ordered not to tell you
much. It&#8217;s a comfort to see you looking brighter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel pretty well. But can you tell me where I
am and how I got there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. We&#8217;ll take the last question first.
Somebody tore off a shutter and we carried you on
it. I guess you know you got a dago&#8217;s knife between
your ribs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I seem to remember something like that,&#8221; said
Dick; who added with awkward gratitude: &#8220;I believe
the brutes would have killed me if you hadn&#8217;t
been there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a pretty near thing. Does it strike you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
as curious that while you made yourself responsible
for me I had to take care of you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You did so, anyhow,&#8221; Dick remarked with feeling.
&#8220;But go on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody brought a Spanish doctor, who said you
couldn&#8217;t be moved much and must be taken into the
nearest house, so we brought you here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is &#8216;here&#8217;? That&#8217;s what I want to
know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My orders are not to let you talk. We&#8217;ve changed
our positions now; you&#8217;ve got to listen. For all that,
you ought to be thankful you&#8217;re not in the Santa
Brigida hospital, which was too far away. It&#8217;s three
hundred years old and smells older. Felt as if you
could bake bricks in it, and no air gets in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what were you doing at the hospital?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I went to see a fellow who told me he&#8217;d been fired
out of our camp. He came up just after the dago
knifed you, and knocked out the man I was grappling
with, but got an ugly stab from one of the gang.
We didn&#8217;t find this out until we had disposed of you.
However, he&#8217;s nearly all right and they&#8217;ll let him out
soon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;That must be Payne, the
storekeeper. But, you see, I fired him. Why did he
interfere?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. He said something about your being
a white man and it was three to one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick pondered this and then his thoughts resumed
their former groove.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s the mulatto woman in black?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s called Lucille. A nice old thing, and seems
to have looked after you well. When I came in she
was singing you to sleep. Voice all gone, of course,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
but I&#8217;d like to write down the song. It sounded like
the genuine article.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by the &#8216;genuine article&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I think it was one of the plantation lullabies
they used to sing before the war; not the imitation
trash fourth-rate composers turned out in floods
some years ago. That, of course, has no meaning,
but the other expressed the spirit of the race. Words
quaint coon-English with a touch of real feeling; air
something after the style of a camp-meeting hymn,
and yet somehow African. In fact, it&#8217;s unique music,
but it&#8217;s good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t I another nurse?&#8221; Dick asked.
</p>
<p>Jake laughed. &#8220;I ought to have remembered that
you&#8217;re not musical. There was a nursing sister of
some religious order.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean a nun,&#8221; Dick persisted. &#8220;A girl
came in now and then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite possible. Some of them are sympathetic
and some are curious. No doubt, you were an
interesting patient; anyhow, you gave the Spanish doctor
plenty trouble. He was rather anxious for a
time; the fever you had before the dago stabbed you
complicated things.&#8221; Jake paused and looked at his
watch. &#8220;Now I&#8217;ve got to quit. I had orders not to
stay long, but I&#8217;ll come back soon to see how you&#8217;re
getting on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick let him go and lay still, thinking drowsily.
Jake had apparently not meant to answer his questions.
He wanted to know where he was and had
not been told. It looked as if his comrade had been
warned not to enlighten him; but there was no reason
for this. Above all, he wanted to know who was
the girl with the sweet voice and light step. Jake,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
who had admitted that she might have been in his
room, had, no doubt, seen her, and Dick could not
understand why he should refuse to speak of her.
While he puzzled about it he went to sleep again.
</p>
<p>It was dark when he awoke, and perhaps he was
feverish or his brain was weakened by illness, for it
reproduced past scenes that were mysteriously connected
with the present. He was in a strange house
in Santa Brigida, for he remarked the shadowy
creeper on the wall and a pool of moonlight on the
dark floor of his room. Yet the cornfields in an
English valley, through which he drove his motor
bicycle, seemed more real, and he could see the rows
of stocked sheaves stretch back from the hedgerows
he sped past. Something sinister and threatening
awaited him at the end of the journey, but he could
not tell what it was. Then the cornfields vanished
and he was crossing a quiet, walled garden with a
girl at his side. He remembered how the moonlight
shone through the branches of a tree and fell in silver,
splashes on her white dress. Her face was in the
shadow, but he knew it well.
</p>
<p>After a time he felt thirsty, and moving his head
looked feebly about the room. A slender, white figure
sat near the wall, and he started, because this must be
the girl he had heard singing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if you could get me something to
drink?&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>The girl rose and he watched her intently as she
came towards him with a glass. When she entered
the moonlight his heart gave a sudden throb.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Clare, Miss Kenwardine!&#8221; he said, and awkwardly
raised himself on his arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I am Clare Kenwardine. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
drink this; then I&#8217;ll put the pillows straight and you
must keep still.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick drained the glass and lay down again, for he
was weaker than he thought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks! Don&#8217;t go back into the dark. You
have been here all the time? I mean, since I came.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As you were seldom quite conscious until this
morning, how did you know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know, in a way, and yet I did. There was
somebody about who made me think of England, and
then, you see, I heard you sing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; she said, smiling, &#8220;I don&#8217;t quite understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you?&#8221; said Dick, who felt he must make
things plain. &#8220;Well, you stole in and out and sat
here sometimes when Lucille was tired. I didn&#8217;t exactly
notice you&mdash;perhaps I was too ill&mdash;but I felt
you were there, and that was comforting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet you are surprised to see me now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t have explained it properly. I didn&#8217;t know
you were Miss Kenwardine; but I felt I knew you
and kept trying to remember, but I was feverish and
my mind wouldn&#8217;t take your image in. For all that,
something told me it was really there already, and
I&#8217;d be able to recognize it if I waited. It was like a
photograph that wasn&#8217;t developed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re feverish now,&#8221; Clare answered quietly.
&#8220;I mustn&#8217;t let you talk so much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re as bad as Jake; he wouldn&#8217;t answer my
questions,&#8221; Dick grumbled. &#8220;Then, you see, I want
to talk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare laughed, as if she found it a relief to do so.
&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t matter if it will do you harm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be very quiet,&#8221; Dick pleaded. &#8220;I&#8217;ll only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
speak a word or two now and then. But don&#8217;t go
away!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare sat down, and after a few minutes Dick resumed:
&#8220;You passed my door to-day, and it&#8217;s curious
that I knew your step, though, if you can understand,
without actually recognizing it. It was as if
I was dreaming something that was real. The worst
of being ill is that your brain gets working independently,
bringing things up on its own account, without
your telling it. Anyhow, I remembered the iron steps
with the glow of the window through the curtain, and
how you slipped&mdash;you wore little white shoes, and
the moonlight shone through the branches on your
dress.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He broke off and frowned, for a vague, unpleasant
memory obtruded itself. Something that had had disastrous
consequences had happened in the quiet garden,
but he could not remember what it was.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did Lucille call you <i>ma mignonne</i>?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it mean a petted child?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not always. She was my nurse when I was
young.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you have lived here before?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not here, but in a country where there are people
like Lucille, though it&#8217;s long ago. But you mustn&#8217;t
speak another word. Go to sleep at once!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then stay where I can see you and I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; Dick
answered; and although he did not mean to do so,
presently closed his eyes.
</p>
<p>Clare waited until his quiet breathing showed that
he was asleep, and then crossed the floor softly and
stood looking down on him. There was light enough
to see his face and it was worn and thin. His weakness
moved her to pity, but there was something else.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
He had remembered that night in England, he knew
her step and voice, and his rambling talk had caused
her a thrill, for she remembered the night in England
well. Brandon had shielded her from a man whom
she had good ground for wishing to avoid. He had,
no doubt, not quite understood the situation, but
had seen that she needed help and chivalrously offered
it. She knew he could be trusted and had without
much hesitation made her unconventional request.
He had then been marked by strong vitality and cheerful
confidence, but he was ill and helpless now, and his
weakness appealed to her as his vigor had not done.
He was, in a way, dependent on her, and Clare felt
glad this was so. She blushed as she smoothed the
coverlet across his shoulders and then quietly stole
away.
</p>
<p>There was no sea breeze next morning and the sun
shone through a yellow haze that seemed to intensify
the heat. The white walls reflected a curious subdued
light that was more trying to the eyes than the
usual glare, and the beat of the surf was slow and
languid. The air was still and heavy, and Dick&#8217;s
fever, which had been abating, recovered force. He
was hot and irritable, and his restlessness did not vanish
until Clare came in at noon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been watching for you since daybreak, and
you might have come before,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Lucille
means well, but she&#8217;s clumsy. She doesn&#8217;t help one
to be quiet as you do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not quiet,&#8221; Clare answered in a reproving
tone. &#8220;Lucille is a very good nurse; better than I
am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Dick in a thoughtful tone, &#8220;perhaps
she is, in a way. She never upsets the medicine on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
my pillow, as you did the last time. The nasty stuff
got into my hair&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare raised her hand in remonstrance. &#8220;You
really mustn&#8217;t talk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to talk,&#8221; Dick answered defiantly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s bad for me to keep puzzling over things, and
I mean to get them straight. Lucille&#8217;s very patient,
but she isn&#8217;t soothing as you are. It rests one&#8217;s eyes
to look at you, but that&#8217;s not altogether why I like
you about. I expect it&#8217;s because you knew I hadn&#8217;t
stolen those plans when everybody else thought I had.
But then why did I tear your letter up?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare made an abrupt movement. She knew he
must be kept quiet and his brain was not working
normally, but his statement was disturbing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You tore it up?&#8221; she asked, with some color in
her face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Dick in a puzzled voice, &#8220;I tore it all
to bits. There was a reason, though I can&#8217;t remember
it. In fact, I can&#8217;t remember anything to-day. But
don&#8217;t go off if I shut my eyes for a minute: it wouldn&#8217;t
be fair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare turned her head, but except for this she did
not move, and it was a relief when after a few disjointed
remarks his voice died away. She was moved
to pity, but for a few moments she had quivered in
the grasp of another emotion. It was obvious that
Dick did not altogether know what he was saying, but
he had shown her plainly the place she had in his
mind, and she knew she would not like to lose it.
</p>
<p>Half an hour later Lucille came in quietly and
Clare went away.

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>CLARE GETS A SHOCK</h3>
</div>

<p>For a week the stagnant heat brooded over Santa
Brigida, sucking up the citizens&#8217; energy and leaving
limp depression. Steaming showers that broke
at intervals filled the air with an enervating damp, and
the nights were worse than the days. No draught
crept through the slits of windows into the darkened
houses, and the musty smell that characterizes old
Spanish cities gathered in the patios and sweltering
rooms.
</p>
<p>This reacted upon Dick, who had a bad relapse,
and for some days caused his nurses grave anxiety.
There was sickness in the town and the doctor could
spare but little time to him, the nursing sister was
occupied, and Dick was, for the most part, left to
Clare and Lucille. They did what they could; the
girl with pitiful tenderness, the mulatto woman with
patience and some skill, but Dick did not know until
afterwards that, in a measure, he owed his life to them.
Youth, however, was on his side, the delirium left
him, and after lying for a day or two in half-conscious
stupor, he came back to his senses, weak but
with unclouded mind. He knew he was getting better
and his recovery would not be long, but his satisfaction
was marred by keen bitterness. Clare had
stolen his papers and ruined him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>Point by point he recalled his visit to Kenwardine&#8217;s
house, trying to find something that could be urged
in the girl&#8217;s defense and when he failed seeking excuses
for her; but her guilt was obvious. He hated
to own it, but the proof was overwhelming. She knew
the power of her beauty and had treated him as a
confiding fool. He was not revengeful and had been
a fool, but it hurt him badly to realize that she was
not what he had thought. He hardly spoke to Lucille,
who came in now and then, and did not ask for Clare,
as he had hitherto done. The girl did not know this
because she was taking the rest she needed after a
week of strain.
</p>
<p>Jake was his first visitor next morning and Dick
asked for a cigarette.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m well enough to do what I like again,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I expect you came here now and then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did, but they would only let me see you once.
I suppose you know you were very ill?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I feel like that. But I dare say you saw
Kenwardine. It looks as if this is his house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is. We brought you here because it&#8217;s near the
street where you got stabbed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick said nothing for a minute, and then asked:
&#8220;What&#8217;s Kenwardine doing in Santa Brigida?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to say. Like other foreigners in the
town, he&#8217;s probably here for what he can get; looking
for concessions or a trading monopoly of some kind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure. But do you
like him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He strikes me as a bit of an adventurer,
but so are the rest of them, and he&#8217;s none the worse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
for that. Trying to get ahead of dago politicians is
a risky job.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he running this place as a gambling house?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jake warmly; &#8220;that&#8217;s much too strong.
There is some card play evenings, and I&#8217;ve lost a few
dollars myself, but the stakes are moderate and anything
he makes on the bank wouldn&#8217;t be worth while.
He enjoys a game, that&#8217;s all. So do other people;
we&#8217;re not all like you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see Miss Kenwardine when you came
for a game?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did, but I want to point out that I came to see
you. She walked through the patio, where we generally
sat, and spoke to us pleasantly, but seldom
stopped more than a minute. A matter of politeness,
I imagine, and no doubt she&#8217;d sooner have stayed
away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kenwardine ought to keep her away. One wonders
why he brought the girl to a place like this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake frowned thoughtfully. &#8220;Perhaps your remark
is justified, in a sense, but you mustn&#8217;t carry
the idea too far. He&#8217;s not using his daughter as an
attraction; it&#8217;s unthinkable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is so,&#8221; agreed Dick.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jake, &#8220;I allow that our talking about
it is in pretty bad taste, but my view is this: Somehow,
I don&#8217;t think Kenwardine has much money and
he may feel he has to give the girl a chance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To marry some gambling rake?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jake sharply. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t follow that
a man is trash because he stakes a dollar or two now
and then, and there are some pretty straight fellows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
in Santa Brigida.&#8221; Then he paused and grinned.
&#8220;Take yourself, for example; you&#8217;ve talent enough
to carry you some way, and I&#8217;m open to allow you&#8217;re
about as sober as a man could be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As it happens, I&#8217;m not eligible,&#8221; Dick rejoined
with a touch of grimness. &#8220;Kenwardine wouldn&#8217;t
think me worth powder and shot, and I&#8217;ve a disadvantage
you don&#8217;t know of yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow, it strikes me you&#8217;re taking a rather
strange line. Kenwardine let us bring you here when
you were badly hurt, and Miss Kenwardine has given
herself a good deal of trouble about you. In fact, I
guess you owe it to her that you&#8217;re recovering.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true, I think,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;I can&#8217;t remember
much about my illness, but I&#8217;ve a notion that
she took very good care of me. Still, there&#8217;s no reason
I should give her further trouble when I&#8217;m getting
better, and I want you to make arrangements for
carrying me back to the dam. Perhaps a hammock
would be the best plan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not fit to be moved yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going, anyhow,&#8221; Dick replied with quiet resolution.
</p>
<p>After trying in vain to persuade him, Jake went
away, and soon afterwards Kenwardine came in. The
light was strong and Dick noted the touches of gray
in his short, dark hair, but except for this he looked
young and athletic. His figure was graceful, his dress
picturesque, for he wore white duck with a colored silk
shirt and red sash, and he had an easy, good-humored
manner. Sitting down close by, he gave Dick a
friendly smile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to find you looking better, but am surprised
to hear you think of leaving us,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My work must be falling behind and Stuyvesant
has nobody to put in my place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He sent word that they were getting on all right,&#8221;
Kenwardine remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid he was overstating it with a good motive.
Then, you see, I have given you and Miss Kenwardine
a good deal of trouble and can&#8217;t take advantage
of your kindness any longer. It would be an
unfair advantage, because I&#8217;m getting well. Of course
I&#8217;m very grateful, particularly as I have no claim on
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a point you can hardly urge. You are
a countryman, and your cousin is a friend of mine. I
think on that ground we are justified in regarding you
as an acquaintance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick was silent for a few moments. He felt that
had things been different he would have liked Kenwardine.
The man had charm and had placed him
under a heavy obligation. Dick admitted this frankly,
but could not stay any longer in his house. He had,
however, a better reason for going than his dislike to
accepting Kenwardine&#8217;s hospitality. Clare had robbed
him and he must get away before he thought of her
too much. It was an awkward situation and he feared
he had not tact enough to deal with it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The truth is, I&#8217;ve no wish to renew my acquaintance
with people I met in England, and I went to
America in order to avoid doing so,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You
know what happened before I left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but I think you are exaggerating its importance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
After all, you&#8217;re not the only man who has,
through nothing worse than carelessness, had a black
mark put against his name. You may have a chance
yet of showing that the thing was a mistake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I must wait until the chance comes,&#8221; Dick
answered firmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Kenwardine. &#8220;Since this means
you&#8217;re determined to go, we must try to make it as
easy as possible for you. I&#8217;ll see the doctor and Mr.
Fuller.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went out, and by and by Clare came in and noted
a difference in Dick. He had generally greeted her
as eagerly as his weakness allowed, and showed his
dependence on her, but now his face was hard and
resolute. The change was puzzling and disturbing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My father tells me you want to go away,&#8221; she
remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to, but I must,&#8221; Dick answered with
a candor he had not meant to show. &#8220;You see, things
I ought to be looking after will all go wrong at the
dam.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that rather egotistical?&#8221; Clare asked with
a forced smile. &#8220;I have seen Mr. Bethune, who
doesn&#8217;t look overworked and probably doesn&#8217;t mind
the extra duty. In fact, he said so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;People sometimes say such things, but when they
have to do a good deal more than usual they mind
very much. Anyhow, it isn&#8217;t fair to ask them, and
that&#8217;s one reason for my going away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare colored and her eyes began to sparkle. &#8220;Do
you think we mind?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; Dick answered awkwardly, feeling that
he was not getting on very well. &#8220;I know how kind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
you are and that you wouldn&#8217;t shirk any trouble. But
still&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose we don&#8217;t think it a trouble?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick knitted his brows. It was hard to believe that
the girl who sat watching him with a puzzled look
was an adventuress. He had made her blush, and
had come near to making her angry, while an adventuress
would not have shown her feelings so easily.
The light that shone through the window touched her
face, and he noted its delicate modeling, the purity of
her skin, and the softness of her eyes. The sparkle
had gone, and they were pitiful. Clare had forgiven
his ingratitude because he was ill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what you think doesn&#8217;t alter the
fact that I have given you trouble and kept you awake
looking after me at night. I wasn&#8217;t always quite
sensible, but I remember how often you sat here and
brought me cool things to drink. Indeed, I expect
you helped to save my life.&#8221; He paused and resumed
in a voice that thrilled with feeling: &#8220;This wasn&#8217;t
all you did. When I was having a very bad time before
I left England and everybody believed the worst,
you sent me a letter saying that you knew I was innocent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You told me you tore up the letter,&#8221; Clare remarked
quietly.
</p>
<p>Dick&#8217;s face got red. He had not taken the line
he meant to take and was obviously making a mess
of things.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure I wasn&#8217;t delirious?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so. Did you tear up the letter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He gave her a steady look, for he saw that he must
nerve himself to face the situation. It was unfortunate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
that he was too ill to deal with it properly, but
he must do the best he could.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll answer that if you&#8217;ll tell me how you knew
I was innocent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare looked puzzled, as if his manner had jarred;
and Dick saw that she was not acting. Her surprise
was real. He could not understand this, but felt
ashamed of himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a sense, of course, I didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; she answered
with a touch of embarrassment. &#8220;Still, I
felt you didn&#8217;t steal the plans. It seemed impossible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Dick, who was silent for the
next few moments. He thought candor was needed
and had meant to be frank, but he could not wound
the girl who had taken care of him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow, I lost the papers and that was almost
as bad,&#8221; he resumed feebly. &#8220;When you get into
trouble people don&#8217;t care much whether you&#8217;re a rogue
or a fool. You&#8217;re in disgrace and that&#8217;s all that matters.
However, I mustn&#8217;t bore you with my grumbling.
I&#8217;m getting better and they want me at the
dam.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I suppose you must go as soon as you are
able,&#8221; Clare agreed, and began to talk about something
else.
</p>
<p>She left him soon and Dick lay still, frowning. It
had been a trying interview and he doubted if he had
come through it well, but hoped Clare would make
allowances for his being ill. He did not want her to
think him ungrateful, and had certainly no wish to
punish her for what had happened in the past. But
she had stolen his papers and he must get away.
</p>
<p>He was taken away next morning, with the consent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
of the doctor, who agreed that the air would be more
invigorating on the hill. Clare did not come down
to see him off and Dick felt strangely disappointed,
although she had wished him a quick recovery on the
previous evening. Kenwardine, however, helped him
into his hammock and after the carriers started went
back to the room where Clare sat. He noted that
although the sun was hot the shutter was not drawn
across the window, which commanded the street.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Mr. Brandon has gone and on
the whole that&#8217;s a relief.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know why he went so soon?&#8221; Clare asked.
</p>
<p>Kenwardine sat down and looked at her thoughtfully.
He was fond of Clare, though he found her
something of an embarrassment now and then. He
was not rich and ran certain risks that made his ability
to provide for her doubtful, while she had no marked
talents to fall back upon if things went against him.
There was, however, the possibility that her beauty
might enable her to make a good marriage, and although
Kenwardine could not do much at present to
forward this plan he must try to prevent any undesirable
entanglement. Brandon, for example, was not
to be thought of, but he suspected Clare of some liking
for the young man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I know and sympathize with him.
In fact, I quite see why he found it difficult to stay.
The situation was only tolerable while he was very
ill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kenwardine meant to tell her. It was better that
she should smart a little now than suffer worse afterwards.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as he began to get better Brandon remembered
that we were the cause of his misfortunes.
You can see how this complicated things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we had nothing to do with them,&#8221; Clare said
sharply. &#8220;What made him think we had?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not an illogical conclusion when he imagines
that he lost his papers in our house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare got up with a red flush in her face and her
eyes sparkling. &#8220;It&#8217;s absurd!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;He
must have been delirious when he said so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t say so in as many words; Brandon has
some taste. But he was perfectly sensible and intended
me to see what he meant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl stood still, trembling with anger and confusion,
and Kenwardine felt sorry for her. She was
worse hurt than he had expected, but she would rally.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But he couldn&#8217;t have been robbed while he was
with us,&#8221; she said with an effort, trying to understand
Dick&#8217;s point of view. &#8220;He hadn&#8217;t an overcoat, so
the plans must have been in the pocket of his uniform,
and nobody except myself was near him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She stopped with a gasp as she remembered how
she had slipped and seized Dick. In doing so her
hand had caught his pocket. Everything was plain
now, and for a few moments she felt overwhelmed.
Her face blanched, but her eyes were hard and very
bright.
</p>
<p>Kenwardine left her, feeling that Brandon would
have cause to regret his rashness if he ever attempted
to renew her acquaintance, and Clare sat down and
tried to conquer her anger. This was difficult, because
she had received an intolerable insult. Brandon
thought her a thief! It was plain that he did so,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
because the change in his manner bore out all her
father had said, and there was no other explanation.
Then she blushed with shame as she realized that
from his point of view her unconventional behavior
warranted his suspicions. She had asked him to come
into the garden and had written him a note! This
was horribly foolish and she must pay for it, but she
had been mistaken about his character.
</p>
<p>She had, as a rule, avoided the men she met at her
father&#8217;s house and had shrunk with frank repugnance
from one or two, but Brandon had seemed different.
Then he had watched for her when he was ill and
she had seen his heavy eyes get brighter when she
came into the room. Now, however, she understood
him better. She had some beauty and he had been
satisfied with her physical attractiveness, although he
thought her a thief. This was worse than the coarse
admiration of the men she had feared. It was unthinkably
humiliating, but her anger helped her to bear
the blow. After all, she was fortunate in finding out
what Brandon was, since it might have been worse
had the knowledge come later. There was a sting in
this that rankled, but she could banish him from her
thoughts now.

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>DICK KEEPS HIS PROMISE</h3>
</div>

<p>Twinkling points of light that pierced the
darkness lower down the hill marked the colored
laborers&#8217; camp, and voices came up faintly
through the still air. The range cut off the land
breeze, though now and then a wandering draught
flickered down the hollow spanned by the dam, and
a smell of hot earth and damp jungle hung about the
veranda of Dick&#8217;s iron shack. He sat near a lamp,
with a drawing-board on his knee, while Jake lounged
in a canvas chair, smoking and occasionally glancing
at the sheet of figures in his hand. His expression
was gloomily resigned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ll have things ready for us in the
morning,&#8221; Dick said presently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;François&#8217; accounts are checked and I&#8217;m surprised
to find them right, but I imagine the other calculations
will not be finished. Anyhow, it won&#8217;t make much
difference whether they are or not. I guess you know
that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course, if you can&#8217;t manage to do the
lot&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t say it&#8217;s impossible,&#8221; Jake rejoined. &#8220;But
beginning work before breakfast is bad enough, without
going on after dinner. Understand that I don&#8217;t
question your authority to find me a job at night; it&#8217;s
your object that makes me kick.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We want the calculations made before we set the
boys to dig.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why didn&#8217;t you give me them when I was
doing nothing this afternoon?&#8221; Jake inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t got the plans ready.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so. You haven&#8217;t had things ready for me
until after dinner all this week. As you&#8217;re a methodical
fellow that&#8217;s rather strange. Still, if you really
want the job finished, I&#8217;ll have to do my best, but
I&#8217;m going out first for a quarter of an hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t,&#8221; Dick said dryly. &#8220;If you mean
to tell the engineer not to wait, he&#8217;s gone. I sent him
off some time since.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you had a right to send him off,&#8221; Jake
replied in an injured tone. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t quite
think&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what your father pays for coal. Have
you reckoned what it costs to keep a locomotive two
or three hours for the purpose of taking you to Santa
Brigida and back?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t, but I expect the old man wouldn&#8217;t stand
for my running a private car,&#8221; Jake admitted. &#8220;However,
it&#8217;s the only way of getting into town.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were there three nights last week. What&#8217;s
more, you tried to draw your next month&#8217;s wages.
That struck me as significant, though I&#8217;d fortunately
provided against it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I found out. I suppose I ought to be grateful
for your thoughtfulness but can&#8217;t say I am. I wanted
the money because I had a run of wretched luck.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At the casino?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jake, shortly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you were at Kenwardine&#8217;s; I&#8217;ll own that&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
what I wanted to prevent. He&#8217;s a dangerous man
and his house is no place for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One would hardly expect you to speak against
him. Considering everything, it&#8217;s perhaps not quite
in good taste.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick put down the drawing-board and looked at
him steadily. &#8220;It&#8217;s very bad taste. In fact, I find
myself in a very awkward situation. Your father
gave me a fresh start when I needed it badly, and
agreed when your sister put you in my charge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ida&#8217;s sometimes a bit officious,&#8221; Jake remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Dick continued, &#8220;I promised to look after
you, and although I didn&#8217;t know what I was undertaking,
the promise must be kept. It&#8217;s true that Kenwardine
afterwards did me a great service; but his
placing me under an obligation doesn&#8217;t relieve me
from the other, which I&#8217;d incurred first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somewhat to his surprise, Jake nodded agreement.
&#8220;No, not from your point of view. But what makes
you think Kenwardine <i>is</i> dangerous?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t answer. You had better take it for granted
that I know what I&#8217;m talking about, and keep away
from him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As a matter of fact, it was Miss Kenwardine to
whom you owed most,&#8221; Jake said meaningly. &#8220;Do
you suggest that she&#8217;s dangerous, too?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick frowned and his face got red, but he said
nothing, and Jake resumed: &#8220;There&#8217;s a mystery
about the matter and you know more than you intend
to tell; but if you blame the girl for anything, you&#8217;re
absolutely wrong. If you&#8217;ll wait a minute, I&#8217;ll show
you what I mean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went into the shack and came back with a drawing-block
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
which he stood upon the table under the
lamp, and Dick saw that it was a water-color portrait
of Clare Kenwardine. He did not know much about
pictures, but it was obvious that Jake had talent. The
girl stood in the patio, with a pale-yellow wall behind
her, over which a vivid purple creeper trailed. Her
lilac dress showed the graceful lines of her slender
figure against the harmonious background, and
matched the soft blue of her eyes and the delicate
white and pink of her skin. The patio was flooded
with strong sunlight, but the girl looked strangely
fresh and cool.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to show you this, but it&#8217;s the best
way of explaining what I think,&#8221; Jake said with some
diffidence. &#8220;I&#8217;m weak in technique, because I haven&#8217;t
been taught, but I imagine I&#8217;ve got sensibility. It&#8217;s
plain that when you paint a portrait you must study
form and color, but there&#8217;s something else that you can
only feel. I don&#8217;t mean the character that&#8217;s expressed
by the mouth and eyes; it&#8217;s something vague and elusive
that psychologists give you a hint of when they
talk about the <i>aura</i>. Of course you can&#8217;t paint it, but
unless it, so to speak, glimmers through the work, your
portrait&#8217;s dead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite understand; but sometimes things
do give you an impression you can&#8217;t analyze,&#8221; Dick
replied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, allowing for poor workmanship, all you see
here&#8217;s harmonious. The blues and purples and yellows
tone, and yet, if I&#8217;ve got the hot glare of the sun
right, you feel that the figure&#8217;s exotic and doesn&#8217;t belong
to the scene. The latter really needs an olive-skinned
daughter of the passionate South; but the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
girl I&#8217;ve painted ought to walk in the moonlight through
cool forest glades.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick studied the picture silently, for he remembered
with disturbing emotion that he had felt what Jake
suggested when he first met Clare Kenwardine. She
was frank, but somehow remote and aloof; marked
by a strange refinement he could find no name for.
He was glad that Jake did not seem to expect him to
speak, but after a few moments the latter wrapped
up the portrait and took it away. When he came back
he lighted a cigarette.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;do you think it&#8217;s sensible to distrust
a girl like that? Admitting that her father
makes a few dollars by gambling, can you believe that
living with him throws any taint on her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick hesitated. Clare had stolen his papers. This
seemed impossible, but it was true. Yet when he
looked up he answered as his heart urged him:
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. It sounds absurd.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is absurd,&#8221; Jake said firmly.
</p>
<p>Neither spoke for the next minute, and then Dick
frowned at a disturbing thought. Could the lad understand
Clare so well unless he loved her?
</p>
<p>&#8220;That picture must have taken some time to paint.
Did Miss Kenwardine often pose for you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jake, rather dryly; &#8220;in fact, she didn&#8217;t
really pose at all. I had trouble to get permission to
make one or two quick sketches, and worked up the
rest from memory.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet she let you sketch her. It was something of
a privilege.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake smiled in a curious way. &#8220;I think I see what
you mean. Miss Kenwardine likes me, but although
I&#8217;ve some artistic taste, I&#8217;m frankly flesh and blood;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
and that&#8217;s not quite her style. She finds me a little
more in harmony with her than the rest, but this is
all. Still, it&#8217;s something to me. Now you understand
matters, perhaps you won&#8217;t take so much trouble
to keep me out of Santa Brigida.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best to keep you away from Kenwardine,&#8221;
Dick declared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; Jake answered with a grin. &#8220;You&#8217;re
quite a good sort, though you&#8217;re not always very
smart, and I can&#8217;t blame you for doing what you think
is your duty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then he set to work on his calculations and there
was silence on the veranda.
</p>
<p>Dick kept him occupied for the next week, and then
prudently decided not to press the lad too hard by
finding him work that obviously need not be done.
If he was to preserve his power, it must be used with
caution. The first evening Jake was free he started
for Santa Brigida, though as there was no longer a
locomotive available, he got two laborers to take him
down the line on a hand-car. After that he had some
distance to walk and arrived at Kenwardine&#8217;s powdered
with dust. It was a hot night and he found
Kenwardine and three or four others in the patio.
</p>
<p>A small, shaded lamp stood upon the table they
had gathered round, and the light sparkled on delicate
green glasses and a carafe of wine. It touched the
men&#8217;s white clothes, and then, cut off by the shade,
left their faces in shadow and fell upon the tiles. A
colored paper lantern, however, hung from a wire near
an outside staircase and Jake saw Clare a short distance
away. It looked as if she had stopped in crossing
the patio, but as he came forward Kenwardine
got up.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s some time since we have seen you,&#8221; he remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jake. &#8220;I meant to come before, but
couldn&#8217;t get away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you have begun to take your business seriously?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My guardian does.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Kenwardine, speaking rather louder,
&#8220;if you mean Mr. Brandon, I certainly thought him
a serious person. But what has this to do with your
coming here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He found me work that kept me busy evenings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;With the object of keeping you out of mischief?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I imagine he meant something of the kind,&#8221; Jake
admitted with a chuckle. He glanced round, and felt
he had been too frank, as his eyes rested on Clare.
He could not see her face, but thought she was listening.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it looks as if he believed we were dangerous
people for you to associate with,&#8221; Kenwardine remarked,
with a smile. &#8220;Well, I suppose we&#8217;re not
remarkable for the conventional virtues.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake, remembering Dick had insisted that Kenwardine
was dangerous, felt embarrassed as he noted
that Clare was now looking at him. To make things
worse, he thought Kenwardine had meant her to hear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect he really was afraid of my going to the
casino,&#8221; he answered as carelessly as he could.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Though he would not be much relieved to find
you had come to my house instead? Well, I suppose
one must make allowances for the Puritan character.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Brandon isn&#8217;t much of a Puritan, and he&#8217;s certainly
not a prig,&#8221; Jake objected.
</p>
<p>Kenwardine laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure this explanation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
makes things much better, but we&#8217;ll let it go. We
were talking about the new water supply. It&#8217;s a harmless
subject and you ought to be interested.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake sat down and stole a glance at Clare as he
drank a glass of wine. There was nothing to be
learned from her face, but he was vexed with Kenwardine,
who had intentionally involved him in an
awkward situation. Jake admitted that he had not
dealt with it very well. For all that, he began to talk
about the irrigation works and the plans for bringing
water to the town, and was relieved to see that Clare
had gone when he next looked round.
</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Clare had quietly stolen away
and was sitting on a balcony in the dark, tingling
with anger and humiliation. She imagined that she
had banished Brandon from her thoughts and was
alarmed to find that he had still power to wound her.
It had been a shock to learn he believed that she had
stolen his papers; but he had now warned his companion
against her father and no doubt herself.
Jake&#8217;s manner when questioned had seemed to indicate
this.
</p>
<p>By and by she tried, not to make excuses for Brandon,
but to understand his point of view, and was
forced to admit that it was not unreasonable. Her
father now and then allowed, or perhaps encouraged,
his guests to play for high stakes, and she had hated
to see the evening gatherings of extravagant young
men at their house in England. Indeed, she had
eagerly welcomed the change when he had offered to
take her abroad because business necessitated his leaving
the country. Things had been better at Santa
Brigida, but after a time the card playing had begun
again. The men who now came to their house were,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
however, of a different type from the rather dissipated
youths she had previously met. They were
quieter and more reserved; men of experience who
had known adventure. Still, she disliked their coming
and had sometimes felt she must escape from a
life that filled her with repugnance. The trouble was
that she did not know where to find a refuge and could
not force herself to leave her father, who had treated
her with good-humored indulgence.
</p>
<p>Then she began to wonder what was the business
that had brought him to Santa Brigida. He did not
talk about it, but she was sure it was not gambling,
as Brandon thought. No doubt he won some money
from his friends, but it could not be much and he
must lose at times. She must look for another explanation
and it was hard to find. Men who did not
play cards came to the house in the daytime and occasionally
late at night, and Kenwardine, who wrote a
good many letters, now and then went away down the
coast. There was a mystery about his occupation that
puzzled and vaguely alarmed her, and she could turn
to nobody for advice. She had refused her aunt&#8217;s
offer of a home and knew it would not be renewed.
They had cast her off and done with her. Getting
up presently with a troubled sigh, she went to her
room.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, Jake stayed in the patio with the
others. A thin, dark Spaniard, who spoke English
well, and two Americans occupied the other side of
the table; a fat German sat nearly opposite the Spaniard
and next to Jake. The heat made them languid
and nobody wanted to play cards, although there was
a pack on the table. This happened oftener than
Brandon thought.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a depressing night and an enervating country,&#8221;
Kenwardine remarked. &#8220;I wonder why we stay
here as we do, since we&#8217;re apt to leave it as poor as
when we came. The people are an unstable lot, and
when you&#8217;ve spent your time and energy developing
what you hope is a profitable scheme, some change of
policy or leaders suddenly cuts it short.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess that explains why we <i>are</i> here,&#8221; one of
the Americans replied. &#8220;The South is the home of
the dramatic surprise and this appeals to us. In the
North, they act by rule and one knows, more or less,
what will happen; but this gives one no chances to bet
upon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The fat German nodded. &#8220;It is the gambler&#8217;s point
of view. You people take with pleasure steep chances,
as they say, but mine act not so. The system is better.
One calculates beforehand what may happen and
it is provided for. If things do not go as one expects,
one labors to change them, and when this is not possible
adopts an alternative plan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But there always is a plan, Señor Richter!&#8221; the
Spaniard remarked.
</p>
<p>Richter smiled. &#8220;With us, I think that is true.
Luck is more fickle than a woman and we like not the
surprise. But our effort is to be prepared for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a pretty hard crowd to run up against,&#8221;
said the other American.
</p>
<p>Jake, who had taken no part in the recent talk, and
leaned languidly back in his chair, turned his head as
he heard footsteps in the patio. They were quick and
decided, as if somebody was coming straight towards
the table, but they stopped suddenly. This seemed
strange and Jake, who had caught a glimpse of a man
in white clothes, looked round to see if Kenwardine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
had made him a sign. The latter, however, was lighting
his pipe, but the Spaniard leaned forward a little,
as if trying to see across the patio. Jake thought he
would find this difficult with the light of the lamp in
his eyes, but Richter, who sat opposite, got up and
reached across the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;With excuses, Don Sebastian, but the wine is on
your side,&#8221; he said, and filled his glass from the decanter
before he sat down.
</p>
<p>In the meantime the man who had come in was
waiting, but seemed to have moved, because Jake could
only see an indistinct figure in the gloom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that you, Enrique?&#8221; Kenwardine asked when
he had lighted his pipe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Sí, señor</i>,&#8221; a voice answered, and Kenwardine
made a sign of dismissal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Bueno!</i> You can tell me about it to-morrow. I
am engaged now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The footsteps began again and when they died away
Kenwardine picked up the cards.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we play for half an hour?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>The others agreed, but the stakes were moderate
and nobody took much interest in the game; and Jake
presently left the house without seeing anything more
of Clare. He felt he had wasted the evening, but as
he walked back to the line he thought about the man
whom Kenwardine had sent away. He did not think
the fellow was one of the servants, and it seemed
strange that Richter should have got up and stood in
front of Don Sebastian when the latter was trying to
see across the patio. Still, there was no apparent
reason why the Spaniard should want to see who had
come in, and Jake dismissed the matter.

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE RETURN FROM THE FIESTA</h3>
</div>

<p>The sure-footed mules, braced hard against the
weight of the carriage, slid down a steep descent
across slippery stones when Clare, who wondered what
would happen if the worn-out harness broke, rode into
Adexe. Gleaming white houses rose one above another
among feathery palms, with a broad streak of
darker green in their midst to mark the shady alameda.
Behind, the dark range towered against the
sky; in front lay a foam-fringed beach and the vast
blue sweep of dazzling sea. Music came up through
the languid murmur of the surf, and the steep streets
were filled with people whose clothes made patches of
brilliant color. The carriage jolted safely down the
hill, and Clare looked about with interest as they turned
into the central plaza, where the driver stopped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a picturesque little town and I&#8217;m glad you
brought me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But what does the fiesta
they&#8217;re holding celebrate?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know; the first landing of the Spaniards,
perhaps,&#8221; Kenwardine replied. &#8220;Anyhow, it&#8217;s a popular
function, and as everybody in the neighborhood
takes part in it, I came with the object of meeting some
people I do business with. In fact, I may have to
leave you for a time with the wife of a Spaniard whom
I know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When coming down the hillside Clare had noticed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
a sugar mill and an ugly coaling wharf that ran out
into the bay. Two steamers lay not far off, rolling
gently on the glittering swell, and several lighters were
moored against the wharf. Since she had never
heard him speak of coal, she imagined her father&#8217;s
business was with the sugar mill, but he seldom talked
to her about such matters and she did not ask. He
took her to an old, yellow house, with tarnished brass
rails barring its lower windows and a marble fountain
in the patio, where brilliant creepers hung from
the balconies. The soft splash of falling water was
soothing and the spray cooled the air.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very pretty,&#8221; Clare said while they waited.
&#8220;I wish we could make our patio like this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We may be able to do so when Brandon and his
friends bring us the water,&#8221; Kenwardine replied with
a quick glance at the girl. &#8220;Have you seen him recently?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for three or four weeks,&#8221; said Clare.
</p>
<p>There was nothing to be learned from her face,
but Kenwardine noted a hint of coldness in her voice.
Next moment, however, a stout lady in a black dress,
and a thin, brown-faced Spaniard came down to meet
them. Kenwardine presented Clare, and for a time
they sat on a balcony, talking in a mixture of French
and Castilian. Then a man came up the outside staircase
and took off his hat as he turned to Kenwardine.
He had a swarthy skin, but Clare carelessly remarked
that the hollows about his eyes were darker than the
rest of his face, as if they had been overlooked in a
hurried wash, and his bare feet were covered with
fine, black dust.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don Martin waits you, señor,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>Kenwardine excused himself to his hostess, and
after promising to return before long went away with
the man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is Don Martin, and does he own the coaling
wharf?&#8221; Clare asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the Spaniard. &#8220;What makes you imagine
so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was some coal-dust on his messenger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Spaniard laughed. &#8220;Your eyes are as keen
as they are bright, señorita, but your father spoke of
business and he does not deal in coal. They use it
for the engine at the sugar mill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Could I follow him to the mill? I would like to
see how they extract the sugar from the cane.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not a good day for that; the machinery will
not be running,&#8221; said the Spaniard, who looked at his
wife.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I meant to take you to the cathedral. Everybody
goes on the fiesta,&#8221; the lady broke in.
</p>
<p>Clare agreed. She suspected that her father had
not gone to the sugar mill, but this did not matter,
and she presently left the house with her hostess. The
small and rather dark cathedral was crowded, and
Clare, who understood very little of what went on,
was impressed by the close rows of kneeling figures,
while the candles glimmering through the incense, and
the music, had their effect. She came out in a thoughtful
mood, partly dazzled by the change of light, and
it was with something of a shock she stopped to avoid
collision with a man at the bottom of the steps. It
was Brandon, and she noted that he looked well again,
but although they were face to face and he waited
with his eyes fixed on her, she turned away and spoke
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
to her companion. Dick crossed the street with his
hand clenched and his face hot, but felt that he had
deserved his rebuff. He could not expect Miss Kenwardine
to meet him as a friend.
</p>
<p>An hour or two later, Kenwardine returned to the
house with Richter, the German, and said he found
he must drive to a village some distance off to meet
an official whom he had expected to see in the town.
He doubted if he could get back that night, but a
sailing barquillo would take passengers to Santa
Brigida, and Clare could go home by her. The girl
made no objection when she heard that two French
ladies, whom she knew, were returning by the boat,
and stayed with her hostess when Kenwardine and
Richter left. Towards evening the Spaniard came
in and stated that the barquillo had sailed earlier than
had been announced, but a steam launch was going
to Santa Brigida with some friends of his on board
and he could get Clare a passage if she would sooner
go. Señor Kenwardine, he added, might drive home
by another road without calling there again.
</p>
<p>Half an hour later Clare went with him to the coaling
wharf, where a launch lay at some steps. A few
people were already on board, and her host left after
putting her in charge of a Spanish lady. The girl
imagined that he was glad to get rid of her, and
thought there was something mysterious about her
father&#8217;s movements. Something he had not expected
must have happened, because he would not have
brought her if he had known he could not take her
home. It was, however, not a long run to Santa
Brigida, by sea, and the launch, which had a powerful
engine, looked fast.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>In another few minutes a man came down the steps
and threw off a rope before he jumped on board.
Taking off his hat to the passengers, he started the
engine and sat down at the helm. Clare did not see
his face until the launch was gliding away from the
wharf, and then hid her annoyance and surprise, for
it was Brandon. His eyes rested on her for a moment
as he glanced about the boat, but she saw he did
not expect recognition. Perhaps she had been wrong
when she passed him outside the cathedral, but it was
now too late to change her attitude.
</p>
<p>The water was smooth, the sun had sunk behind the
range, and a warm breeze that ruffled the shining surface
with silky ripples blew off the shore. The rumble
of the surf came in a deep undertone through the
throb of the engine, and the launch sped on with a
frothy wave curling at her bows. Now and then
Clare glanced quickly at the helmsman, who sat with
his arm thrown round the tiller. She thought he
looked disturbed, and felt sorry, though she told herself
that she had done the proper thing.
</p>
<p>After a time the launch swung in towards the beach
and stopped at a rude landing behind a reef. Houses
showed among the trees not far off and Clare thought
this was the pueblo of Arenas. Then she was disturbed
to see that all her companions were going to
land. When the Spanish lady said good-by she got
up, with the idea of following the rest, but Dick
stopped her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you expect Mr. Kenwardine to meet you?&#8221;
he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I was told the launch was going to Santa
Brigida, but didn&#8217;t know that she was yours.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>Dick eyes twinkled. &#8220;I am going to Santa Brigida
and the boat is one we use, but my colored fireman refused
to leave the fiesta. Now you can&#8217;t stay at
Arenas, and I doubt if you can get a mule to take you
home, because they&#8217;ll all have gone to Adexe. But,
if you like, we&#8217;ll go ashore and try.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think I could find a carriage?&#8221; Clare
asked irresolutely, seeing that if she now showed herself
determined to avoid him, it would be humiliating
to be forced to fall back upon his help.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t. Besides, it&#8217;s some distance to Santa
Brigida over a rough, steep road that you&#8217;d find very
awkward in the dark, while as I can land you in an
hour, it seems unnecessary for you to leave the boat
here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Clare, &#8220;perhaps it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick threw some coal into the furnace, and restarted
the launch. The throb of the engine was
quicker than before, and when a jet of steam blew
away from the escape-pipe Clare imagined that he
meant to lose no time. She glanced at him as he sat
at the helm with a moody face; and then away at
the black hills that slid past. The silence was embarrassing
and she wondered whether he would break
it. On the whole, she wanted him to do so, but would
give him no help.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he said at length, &#8220;you needn&#8217;t talk
if you&#8217;d sooner not. But you gave me the cut direct
in Adexe, and although I may have deserved it, it
hurt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why it should hurt,&#8221; Clare answered
coldly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Well, you have the right
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
to choose your acquaintances; but I once thought we
were pretty good friends and I mightn&#8217;t have got better
if you hadn&#8217;t taken care of me. That ought to
count for something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare blushed, but her eyes sparkled and her glance
was steady. &#8220;If we are to have an explanation, it
must be complete and without reserve. Very well!
Why did you change when you were getting better?
And why did you hint that I must know you hadn&#8217;t
stolen the plans?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick studied her with some surprise. He had
thought her gentle and trustful, but saw that she
burned with imperious anger. It certainly was not
acting and contradicted the supposition of her guilt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I did hint anything of the kind, I must have
been a bit light-headed,&#8221; he answered awkwardly.
&#8220;You get morbid fancies when you have fever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The fever had nearly gone. You were braver
then than you seem to be now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose that&#8217;s true. Sometimes a shock gives
you pluck and I got a nasty one as I began to remember
things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Both were silent for the next few moments. Clare&#8217;s
pose was tense and her look strained, but her anger
had vanished. Dick thought she was calmer than
himself, but after all, she was, so to speak, on her
defense and her part was easier than his. He had
forgiven her for robbing him; Kenwardine had forced
her to do so, and Dick regretted he had not hidden his
knowledge of the deed she must have hated. It was
bodily weakness that had led him to show his suspicion,
but he knew that if they were to be friends again
no reserve was possible. As Clare had said, the explanation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
must be complete. It was strange, after
what had happened, that he should want her friendship,
but he did want it, more than anything else. Yet
she must be told plainly what he had thought her.
He shrank from the task.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you remember?&#8221; Clare asked, forcing
herself to look at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That I had the plans in the left, top pocket of my
uniform when I reached your house; I felt to see if
they were there as I came up the drive,&#8221; he answered
doggedly. &#8220;Soon afterward, you slipped as we went
down the steps into the garden and in clutching me
your hand caught and pulled the pocket open. It was
a deep pocket and the papers could not have fallen
out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you concluded that I had stolen them!&#8221; Clare
said in a cold, strained voice, though her face flushed
crimson.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What else could I think?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then, though she tried to hide the breakdown,
Clare&#8217;s nerve gave way. She had forced the crisis
in order to clear herself, but saw that she could not
do so. Dick&#8217;s statement was convincing; the papers
had been stolen while he was in their house, and she
had a horrible suspicion that her father was the thief.
It came with a shock, though she had already been
tormented by a vague fear of the truth that she had
resolutely refused to face. She remembered the men
who were at the house on the eventful night. They
were somewhat dissipated young sportsmen and not
remarkable for intelligence. None of them was
likely to take part in such a plot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must understand what a serious thing you are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
saying,&#8221; she faltered, trying to doubt him and finding
that she could not.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; he said, regarding her with gravely pitiful
eyes. &#8220;Still, you rather forced it out of me. Perhaps
this is a weak excuse, because I had meant to
forget the matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But didn&#8217;t you want to clear yourself and get
taken back?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I knew it was too late. I&#8217;d shown I couldn&#8217;t
be trusted with an important job; and I&#8217;d made a
fresh start here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His answer touched the girl, and after a quick half-ashamed
glance, she thought she had misjudged him.
It was not her physical charm that had made him willing
to condone her offense, for he showed none of the
bold admiration she had shrunk from in other men.
Instead, he was compassionate and, she imagined,
anxious to save her pain.
</p>
<p>She did not answer and turning her head, vacantly
watched the shore slide past. The mountains were
growing blacker, trails of mist that looked like gauze
gathered in the ravines, and specks of light began to
pierce the gloom ahead. They marked Santa Brigida,
and something must still be said before the launch
reached port. It was painful that Brandon should
take her guilt for granted, but she feared to declare her
innocence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were hurt when I passed you at Adexe,&#8221; she
remarked, without looking at him. &#8220;You must, however,
see that friendship between us is impossible while
you think me a thief.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must try to explain,&#8221; Dick said slowly. &#8220;When
I recovered my senses at your house after being ill,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
I felt I must get away as soon as possible, though
I ought to have remembered only that you had taken
care of me. Still, you see, my mind was weak just
then. Afterwards I realized how ungratefully I had
behaved. The plans didn&#8217;t matter; they weren&#8217;t really
of much importance, and I knew if you had taken
them, it was because you were forced. That made
all the difference; in a way, you were not to blame.
I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; he concluded lamely, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t made it
very clear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare was moved by his naïve honesty, which seemed
to be guarded by something finer than common sense.
After all, he had made things clear. He owned that
he believed she had taken the plans, and yet he did
not think her a thief. On the surface, this was rather
involved, but she saw what he meant. Still, it did not
carry them very far.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not long since you warned Mr. Fuller against
us,&#8221; she resumed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not against you; that would have been absurd.
However, Jake&#8217;s something of a gambler and your
father&#8217;s friends play for high stakes. The lad was
put in my hands by people who trusted me to look
after him. I had to justify their confidence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. But you must understand that my
father and I stand together. What touches him,
touches me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick glanced ahead. The lights of Santa Brigida
had drawn out in a broken line, and those near the
beach were large and bright. A hundred yards away,
two twinkling, yellow tracks stretched across the water
from the shadowy bulk of a big cargo boat. Farther
on, he could see the black end of the mole washed by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
frothy surf. There was little time for further talk
and no excuse for stopping the launch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true in a sense,&#8221; he agreed with forced
quietness. &#8220;I&#8217;ve done you an injustice, Miss Kenwardine;
so much is obvious, but I can&#8217;t understand
the rest just yet. I suppose I mustn&#8217;t ask you to forget
the line I took?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t be friends as if nothing had happened.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick made a gesture of moody acquiescence.
&#8220;Well, perhaps something will clear up the matter
by and by. I must wait, because while it&#8217;s difficult
now, I feel it will come right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A minute or two later he ran the launch alongside
a flight of steps on the mole, and helping Clare to
land went with her to her house. They said nothing
on the way, but she gave him her hand when he left
her at the door.

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>COMPLICATIONS</h3>
</div>

<p>It was dark outside the feeble lamplight, and very
hot, when Dick sat on his veranda after a day
of keen activity in the burning sun. He felt slack
and jaded, for he had had difficult work to do and his
dusky laborers had flagged under the unusual heat.
There was now no touch of coolness in the stagnant
air, and although the camp down the valley was very
quiet a confused hum of insects came out of the jungle.
It rose and fell with a monotonous regularity that
jarred upon Dick&#8217;s nerves as he forced himself to
think.
</p>
<p>He was in danger of falling in love with Clare Kenwardine;
indeed, he suspected that it would be better
to face the truth and admit that he had already done
so. The prudent course would be to fight against and
overcome his infatuation; but suppose he found this
impossible, as he feared? It seemed certain that she
had stolen his papers; but after all he did not hold her
accountable. Some day he would learn more about
the matter and find that she was blameless. He had
been a fool to think harshly of her, but he knew now
that his first judgment was right. Clare, who could
not have done anything base and treacherous, was much
too good for him. This, however, was not the subject
with which he meant to occupy himself, because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
if he admitted that he hoped to marry Clare, there were
serious obstacles in his way.
</p>
<p>To begin with, he had made it difficult, if not impossible,
for the girl to treat him with the friendliness
she had previously shown; besides which, Kenwardine
would, no doubt, try to prevent his meeting her, and
his opposition would be troublesome. Then it was
plainly desirable that she should be separated from
her father, who might involve her in his intrigues, because
there was ground for believing that he was a
dangerous man. In the next place, Dick was far from
being able to support a wife accustomed to the extravagance
that Kenwardine practised. It might be long
before he could offer her the lowest standard of comfort
necessary for an Englishwoman in a hot, foreign
country.
</p>
<p>He felt daunted, but not altogether hopeless, and
while he pondered the matter Bethune came in. On
the whole, Dick found his visit a relief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect you&#8217;ll be glad to hear we can keep the
machinery running,&#8221; Bethune said as he sat down.
</p>
<p>Dick nodded. Their fuel was nearly exhausted,
for owing to strikes and shortage of shipping Fuller
had been unable to keep them supplied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you have got some coal? As there&#8217;s none
at Santa Brigida just now, where&#8217;s it coming from?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Adexe. Four big lighter loads. Stuyvesant has
given orders to have them towed round.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understood the Adexe people didn&#8217;t keep a big
stock. The wharf is small.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So did I, but it seems that Kenwardine came to
Stuyvesant and offered him as much as he wanted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kenwardine!&#8221; Dick exclaimed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>Bethune lighted his pipe. &#8220;Yes, Kenwardine. As
the wharf&#8217;s supposed to be owned by Spaniards, I
don&#8217;t see what he has to do with it, unless he&#8217;s recently
bought them out. Anyhow, it&#8217;s high-grade
navigation coal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better stuff than we need, but the difference in
price won&#8217;t matter if we can keep the concrete mill
going,&#8221; Dick remarked thoughtfully. &#8220;Still, it&#8217;s puzzling.
If Kenwardine has bought the wharf, why&#8217;s he
sending the coal away, instead of using it in the regular
bunkering trade?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a hint of mystery about the matter. I
expect you heard about the collier tramp that was
consigned to the French company at Arucas? Owing
to some dispute, they wouldn&#8217;t take the cargo and the
shippers put it on the market. Fuller tried to buy
some, but found that another party had got the lot.
Well, Stuyvesant believes it was the German, Richter,
who bought it up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jake tells me that Richter&#8217;s a friend of Kenwardine&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; said Bethune. &#8220;They
may have bought the cargo for some particular purpose,
for which they afterwards found it wouldn&#8217;t
be required, and now want to sell some off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Kenwardine must have more money than I
thought.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The money may be Richter&#8217;s,&#8221; Bethune replied.
&#8220;However, since we&#8217;ll now have coal enough to last
until Fuller sends some out, I don&#8217;t know that we
have any further interest in the matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He glanced keenly at Dick&#8217;s thoughtful face; and
then, as the latter did not answer, talked about something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
else until he got up to go. After he had gone,
Dick leaned back in his chair with a puzzled frown.
He had met Richter and rather liked him, but the
fellow was a German, and it was strange that he
should choose an English partner for his speculations,
as he seemed to have done. But while Kenwardine
was English, Dick&#8217;s papers had been stolen at his
house, and his distrust of the man grew stronger.
There was something suspicious about this coal deal,
but he could not tell exactly what his suspicions pointed
to, and by and by he took up the plan of a culvert
they were to begin next morning.
</p>
<p>A few days later, Jake and he sat, one night, in the
stern of the launch, which lay head to sea about half
a mile from the Adexe wharf. The promised coal
had not arrived, and, as fuel was running very short
at the concrete mill, Dick had gone to see that a
supply was sent. It was late when he reached Adexe,
and found nobody in authority about, but three loaded
lighters were moored at the wharf, and a gang of
peons were trimming the coal that was being thrown
on board another. Ahead of the craft lay a small
tug with steam up. As the half-breed foreman declared
that he did not know whether the coal was going
to Santa Brigida or not, Dick boarded the tug and
found her Spanish captain drinking caña with his engineer.
Dick thought one looked at the other meaningly
as he entered the small, hot cabin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s Señor Fuller&#8217;s coal in the barges,
and we&#8217;re badly in want of it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As you
have steam up, you&#8217;ll start soon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We start, yes,&#8221; answered the skipper, who spoke
some English, and then paused and shrugged. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
do not know if we get to Santa Brigida to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Dick asked. &#8220;There&#8217;s not very much
wind, and it&#8217;s partly off the land.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The half-breed engineer described in uncouth Castilian
the difficulties he had had with a defective pump
and leaking glands, and Dick, who did not understand
much of it, went back to his launch. Stopping the
craft a short distance from the harbor, he said to
Jake: &#8220;We&#8217;ll wait until they start. Somehow I
don&#8217;t think they meant to leave to-night if I hadn&#8217;t
turned them out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake looked to windward. There was a moon in
the sky, which was, however, partly obscured by driving
clouds. The breeze was strong, but, blowing
obliquely off the land did not ruffle the sea much near
the beach. A long swell, however, worked in, and
farther out the white tops of the combers glistened in
the moonlight. Now and then a fresher gust swept
off the shadowy coast and the water frothed in angry
ripples about the launch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They ought to make Santa Brigida, though they&#8217;ll
find some sea running when they reach off-shore to
go round the Tajada reef,&#8221; he remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s water enough through the inside channel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; Jake agreed. &#8220;Still, it&#8217;s narrow and
bad to find in the dark, and I expect the skipper would
sooner go outside.&#8221; Then he glanced astern and said,
&#8220;They&#8217;re coming out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Two white lights, one close above the other, with
a pale red glimmer below, moved away from the
wharf. Behind them three or four more twinkling
red spots appeared, and Dick told the fireman to start
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
the engine half-speed. Steering for the beach, he
followed the fringe of surf, but kept abreast of the
tug, which held to a course that would take her round
the end of the reef.
</p>
<p>When the moon shone through he could see her
plunge over the steep swell and the white wash at
the lighters&#8217; bows as they followed in her wake;
then as a cloud drove past, their dark hulls faded
and left nothing but a row of tossing lights. By and
by the launch reached a bend in the coastline and the
breeze freshened and drew more ahead. The swell
began to break and showers of spray blew on board,
while the sea got white off-shore.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get it worse when we open up the Arenas
bight,&#8221; said Jake as he glanced at the lurching tug.
&#8220;It looks as if the skipper meant to give the reef a
wide berth. He&#8217;s swinging off to starboard. Watch
his smoke.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have done some yachting, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; said Jake. &#8220;I used to sail a shoal-draught
sloop on Long Island Sound. Anyway, if
I&#8217;d been towing those coal-scows, I&#8217;d have edged in
near the beach, for the sake of smoother water, and
wouldn&#8217;t have headed out until I saw the reef. It
will be pretty wet on board the scows now, and they&#8217;ll
have had to put a man on each to steer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick nodded agreement and signed the fireman to
turn on more steam as he followed the tug outshore.
The swell got steadily higher and broke in angry
surges. The launch plunged, and rattled as she swung
her screw out of the sea, but Dick kept his course
abreast of the tug, which he could only distinguish
at intervals between the clouds of spray. Her masthead
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
lights reeled wildly to and fro, but the low red
gleam from the barges was hidden and he began to
wonder why her captain was steering out so far. It
was prudent not to skirt the reef, but the fellow seemed
to be giving it unnecessary room. The lighters would
tow badly through the white, curling sea, and there
was a risk of the hawsers breaking. Besides, the engineer
had complained that his machinery was not
running well.
</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later, a belt of foam between
them and the land marked the reef, and the wind
brought off the roar of breaking surf. Soon afterwards,
the white surge faded, and only the tug&#8217;s lights
were left as a long cloud-bank drove across the moon.
Jake stood up, shielding his eyes from the spray.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s broken his rope; the coal&#8217;s adrift!&#8221; he cried.
</p>
<p>Dick saw the tug&#8217;s lights vanish, which meant that
she had turned with her stern towards the launch;
and then two or three twinkling specks some distance
off.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d tow the first craft with a double rope, a
bridle from his quarters,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s strange that
both parts broke, and, so far as I can make out, the
tail barge has parted her hawser, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A whistle rang out, and Dick called for full-speed
as the tug&#8217;s green light showed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll help him to pick up the barges,&#8221; he remarked.
</p>
<p>The moon shone out as they approached the nearest,
and a bright beam swept across the sea until it
touched the lurching craft. Her wet side glistened
about a foot above the water and then vanished as a
white surge lapped over it and washed across her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
deck. A rope trailed from her bow and her long
tiller jerked to and fro. It was obvious that she was
adrift with nobody on board, and Dick cautiously
steered the launch towards her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s curious, but perhaps the rest drove foul
of her and the helmsman lost his nerve and jumped,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll put Maccario on board to give us the
hawser.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll go with him,&#8221; Jake offered. &#8220;He can&#8217;t
handle the big rope alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick hesitated. It was important that they should
not lose the coal, but he did not want to give the
lad a dangerous task. The barge was rolling wildly
and he durst not run alongside, while some risk would
attend a jump across the three or four feet of water
between the craft.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;d better stop here,&#8221; he objected.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; Jake answered with a laugh. &#8220;Guess
you&#8217;ve got to be logical. You want the coal, and it
will take us both to save it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He followed the fireman, who stood, balancing himself
for a spring, on the forward deck, while Dick
let the launch swing in as close as he thought safe.
The man leapt and Dick watched Jake with keen anxiety
as the launch rose with the next comber, but the
lad sprang off as the bows went up, and came down
with a splash in the water that flowed across the lighter&#8217;s
deck. Then Dick caught the line thrown him and
with some trouble dragged the end of the hawser on
board. He was surprised to find that it was not
broken, but he waved his hand to the others as he
drove the launch ahead, steering for the beach, near
which he expected to find a passage through the reef.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>Before he had gone far the tug steamed towards
him with the other barges in tow, apparently bound
for Adexe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not possible to go on,&#8221; the skipper hailed.
&#8220;Give me a rope; we take the lighter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You shan&#8217;t take her to Adexe,&#8221; Dick shouted.
&#8220;We want the coal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Though there was danger in getting too close, the
captain let the tug drift nearer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We bring you the lot when the wind drops.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;I&#8217;ll stick to what I&#8217;ve got.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He could not catch the captain&#8217;s reply as the tug
forged past, but it sounded like an exclamation of
anger or surprise, and he looked anxiously for the
foam upon the reef. It was some time before he
distinguished a glimmer in the dark, for the moon
was hidden and his progress was slow. The lighter
was big and heavily laden, and every now and then
her weight, putting a sudden strain on the hawser,
jerked the launch to a standstill. It was worse when,
lifting with the swell, she sheered off at an angle to
her course, and Dick was forced to maneuver with
helm and engine to bring her in line again, at some
risk of fouling the hawser with the screw. He knew
little about towing, but he had handled small sailing
boats before he learned to use the launch. The coal
was badly needed and must be taken to Santa Brigida,
though an error of judgment might lead to the loss
of the barge and perhaps of his comrade&#8217;s life.
</p>
<p>The phosphorescent gleam of the surf got plainer
and the water smoother, for the reef was now to windward
and broke the sea, but the moon was still covered,
and Dick felt some tension as he skirted the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
barrier. He did not know if he could find the opening
or tow the lighter through the narrow channel.
The surf, however, was of help, for it flashed into
sheets of spangled radiance as it washed across the
reef, leaving dark patches among the lambent foam.
The patches had a solid look, and Dick knew that they
were rocks.
</p>
<p>At length he saw a wider break in the belt of foam,
and the sharper plunging of the launch showed that
the swell worked through. This was the mouth of
the channel, and there was water enough to float
the craft if he could keep off the rocks. Snatching
the engine-lamp from its socket, he waved it and
blew the whistle. A shout reached him and showed
that the others understood.
</p>
<p>Dick felt his nerves tingle when he put the helm over
and the hawser tightened as the lighter began to
swing. If she took too wide a sweep, he might be
unable to check her before she struck the reef, and
there seemed to be a current flowing through the gap.
Glancing astern for a moment, he saw her dark hull
swing through a wide curve while the strain on the
hawser dragged the launch&#8217;s stern down, but she came
round and the tension slackened as he steered up the
channel.
</p>
<p>For a time he had less trouble than he expected;
but the channel turned at its outer end and wind and
swell would strike at him at an awkward angle, when
he took the bend. As he entered it, the moon shone
out, and he saw the black top of a rock dangerously
close to leeward. He waved the lantern, but the
lighter, with sea and current on her weather bow,
forged almost straight ahead, and the straining hawser
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
dragged the launch back. Reaching forward, Dick
opened the throttle valve to its limit, and then sat grim
and still while the throb of the screw shook the trembling
hull. Something would happen in the next half
minute unless he could get the lighter round. Glancing
back, he saw her low, wet side shine in the moonlight.
Two dark figures stood aft by the tiller, and he thought
the foam about the rock was only a fathom or two
away.
</p>
<p>The launch was hove down on her side. Though
the screw thudded furiously, she seemed to gain no
ground, and then the strain on the hawser suddenly
slackened. Dick wondered whether it had broken,
but he would know in the next few seconds; there
was a sharp jerk, the launch was dragged to leeward,
but recovered and forged ahead. She plunged her
bows into a broken swell and the spray filled Dick&#8217;s
eyes, but when he could see again the foam was sliding
past and a gap widened between the lighter&#8217;s hull and
the white wash on the rock.
</p>
<p>The water was deep ahead, and since he could skirt
the beach and the wind came strongly off the land, the
worst of his difficulties seemed to be past. Still, it
would be a long tow to Santa Brigida, and bracing
himself for the work, he lit his pipe.

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE MISSING COAL</h3>
</div>

<p>Early next morning Dick stood in front of the
Hotel Magellan, where he had slept for a few
hours after his return, and was somewhat surprised
to see that Jake had got up before him and was talking
to a pretty, dark-skinned girl. She carried a
large bunch of flowers and a basket of fruit stood close
by, while Jake seemed to be persuading her to part
with some.
</p>
<p>Dick stopped and watched them, for the glow of
color held his eye. Jake&#8217;s white duck caught the
strong sunlight, while the girl&#8217;s dark hair and eyes
were relieved by the brilliant lemon-tinted wall and
the mass of crimson bloom. Her attitude was coquettish,
and Jake regarded her with an ingratiating smile.
After a few moments, however, Dick went down the
street and presently heard his comrade following him.
When the lad came up, he saw that he had a basket
of dark green fruit and a bunch of the red flowers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you were asleep. Early rising is not a
weakness of yours,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As it happens, I didn&#8217;t sleep at all,&#8221; Jake replied.
&#8220;Steering that unhandy coal-scow rather got upon my
nerves and when she took the awkward sheer as we
came through the reef the tiller knocked Maccario
down and nearly broke my ribs. I had to stop the
helm going the wrong way somehow.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>Dick nodded. It was obvious that the lad had been
quick and cool at a critical time, but his twinkling
smile showed that he was now in a different mood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to have recovered. But why couldn&#8217;t
you leave the girl alone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure she&#8217;d have liked that,&#8221; Jake replied.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity you have no artistic taste, or you might
have seen what a picture she made.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As a matter of fact, I did see it, but she has, no
doubt, a half-breed lover who&#8217;d seriously misunderstand
your admiration, which might lead to your getting
stabbed some night. Anyhow, why did you buy
the flowers?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For one thing, she was taking them to the Magellan,
and I couldn&#8217;t stand for seeing that blaze of color
wasted on the guzzling crowd you generally find in a
hotel dining-room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t apply to the fruit. You can&#8217;t eat
those things. They preserve them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eat them!&#8221; Jake exclaimed with a pitying look.
&#8220;Well, I suppose it&#8217;s the only use you have for fruit.&#8221;
He took a stalk fringed with rich red bloom and laid
it across the dark green fruit, which was packed
among glossy leaves. &#8220;Now, perhaps, you&#8217;ll see why
I bought it. I rather think it makes a dainty offering.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;To whom do you propose to
offer it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Kenwardine,&#8221; Jake replied with a twinkle;
&#8220;though of course her proper color&#8217;s Madonna blue.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick said nothing, but walked on, and when Jake
asked where he was going, answered shortly: &#8220;To
the telephone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jake, &#8220;knowing you as I do, I suspected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
something of the kind. With the romance of
the South all round you, you can&#8217;t rise above concrete
and coal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He followed Dick to the public telephone office and
sat down in the box with the flowers in his hands. A
line had recently been run along the coast, and although
the service was bad, Dick, after some trouble,
got connected with a port official at Arenas.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did a tug and three coal barges put into your
harbor last night?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, señor,&#8221; was the answer, and Dick asked for
the coal wharf at Adexe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you call them first?&#8221; Jake inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a reason. The tug was standing to leeward
when she left us, but if her skipper meant to come
back to Santa Brigida, he&#8217;d have to put into Arenas,
where he&#8217;d find shelter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re not sure he meant to come back?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve some doubts,&#8221; Dick answered dryly, and was
told that he was connected with the Adexe wharf.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What about the coal for the Fuller irrigation
works?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The tug and four lighters left last night,&#8221; somebody
answered in Castilian, and Dick imagined from
the harshness of the voice that one of the wharf-hands
was speaking.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is so,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Has she returned yet?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, señor,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;The tug&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He broke off, and there was silence for some moments,
after which a different voice took up the conversation
in English.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry it may be a day or two before we can send
more of your coal. The tug&#8217;s engines&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Has she got back?&#8221; Dick demanded sharply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Speak louder; I cannot hear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick did so, but the other did not seem to understand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In two or three days. You have one lighter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have. I want to know if the tug&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The damage is not serious,&#8221; the other broke in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m to understand she&#8217;s back in port?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A broken murmur answered, but by and by Dick
caught the words, &#8220;Not longer than two days.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then he rang off, and pushing Jake&#8217;s chair out of
the way, shut the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s plain that they don&#8217;t mean to tell me what I
want to know,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;The first man might
have told the truth, if they had let him, but somebody
pulled him away. My opinion is that the tug&#8217;s not
at Adexe and didn&#8217;t go there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They went back to the hotel, and Dick sat down on
a bench in the patio and lighted his pipe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something very curious about the matter,&#8221;
he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When the tug left us she seemed to be heading
farther off shore than was necessary,&#8221; Jake agreed.
&#8220;Still, the broken water wouldn&#8217;t matter so much
when she had the wind astern.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Her skipper wouldn&#8217;t run off his course and
lengthen the distance because the wind was fair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t suppose he would.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;my impression is that he
didn&#8217;t mean to start at all, and wouldn&#8217;t have done so
if I hadn&#8217;t turned him out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake laughed. &#8220;After all, there&#8217;s no use in making
a mystery out of nothing. The people offered us the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
coal, and you don&#8217;t suspect a dark plot to stop the
works. What would they gain by that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing that I can see. I don&#8217;t think they meant
to stop the works; but they wanted the coal. It&#8217;s not
at Adexe, and there&#8217;s no other port the tug could reach.
Where has it gone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem to matter, so long as we get a
supply before our stock runs out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Try to look at the thing as I do,&#8221; Dick insisted
with a frown. &#8220;I forced the skipper to go to sea,
and as soon as he had a good excuse his tow-rope
parted, besides which the last barge went adrift from
the rest. Her hawser, however, wasn&#8217;t broken. It
was slipped from the craft she was made fast to.
Then, though the tug&#8217;s engines were out of order, she
steamed to leeward very fast and, I firmly believe,
hasn&#8217;t gone back to Adexe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect there&#8217;s a very simple explanation,&#8221; Jake
replied. &#8220;The truth is you have a rather senseless
suspicion of Kenwardine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll own I don&#8217;t trust him,&#8221; Dick answered
quietly.
</p>
<p>Jake made an impatient gesture. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see if we
can get breakfast, because I&#8217;m going to his house
afterwards.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t have got up yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s curious that you don&#8217;t know more about their
habits after living there. Miss Kenwardine goes out
with Lucille before the sun gets hot, and her father&#8217;s
about as early as you are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What does he do in the morning?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t inquired, but I&#8217;ve found him in the room
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
he calls his office. You&#8217;re misled by the idea that his
occupation is gambling.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick did not reply, and was silent during breakfast.
He understood Jake&#8217;s liking for Kenwardine because
there was no doubt the man had charm. His careless,
genial air set one at one&#8217;s ease; he had a pleasant
smile, and a surface frankness that inspired confidence.
Dick admitted that if he had not lost the
plans at his house, he would have found it difficult
to suspect him. But Jake was right on one point;
Kenwardine might play for high stakes, but gambling
was not his main occupation. He had some more important
business. The theft of the plans, however,
offered no clue to this. Kenwardine was an adventurer
and might have thought he could sell the drawings,
but since he had left England shortly afterwards,
it was evident that he was not a regular foreign spy.
It was some relief to think so, and although there was
a mystery about the coal, which Dick meant to fathom
if he could, nothing indicated that Kenwardine&#8217;s trickery
had any political aim.
</p>
<p>Dick dismissed the matter and remembered with
half-jealous uneasiness that Jake seemed to know a
good deal about Kenwardine&#8217;s household. The lad,
of course, had gone to make inquiries when he was
ill, and had probably been well received. He was very
little younger than Clare, and Fuller was known to
be rich. It would suit Kenwardine if Jake fell in love
with the girl, and if not, his extravagance might be
exploited. For all that, Dick determined that his comrade
should not be victimized.
</p>
<p>When breakfast was over they left the hotel and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
presently met Clare, who was followed by Lucille
carrying a basket. She looked very fresh and cool in
her white dress. On the whole, Dick would sooner
have avoided the meeting, but Jake stopped and Clare
included Dick in her smile of greeting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been to the market with Lucille,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;The fruit and the curious things they have upon the
stalls are worth seeing. But you seem to have been
there, though I did not notice you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jake, indicating the flowers and fruit
he carried. &#8220;I got these at the hotel. The colors
matched so well that I felt I couldn&#8217;t let them go, and
then it struck me that you might like them. Dick
warned me that the things are not eatable in their
present state, which is a pretty good example of his
utilitarian point of view.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare laughed as she thanked him, and he resumed:
&#8220;Lucille has enough to carry, and I&#8217;d better bring the
basket along.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Clare. &#8220;My father was getting
up when I left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick said nothing, and stood a yard or two away.
The girl had met him without embarrassment, but it
was Jake she had addressed. He felt that he was, so
to speak, being left out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll come and talk to him for a while,&#8221; said
Jake. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know a nicer place on a hot morning
than your patio.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what about your work? Are you not needed
at the dam?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My work can wait. I find from experience that
it will keep for quite a long time without shriveling
away, though often it gets very stale. Anyhow, after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
being engaged on the company&#8217;s business for the most
part of last night, I&#8217;m entitled to a rest. My partner,
of course, doesn&#8217;t look at things like that. He&#8217;s going
back as fast as he can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick hid his annoyance at the hint. It was impossible
to prevent the lad from going to Kenwardine&#8217;s
when Clare was there to hear his objections, and he
had no doubt that Jake enjoyed his embarrassment.
Turning away, he tried to forget the matter by thinking
about the coal. Since Kenwardine was at home,
it was improbable that he had been at Adexe during
the night. If Clare had a part in her father&#8217;s plots,
she might, of course, have made the statement about
his getting up with an object, but Dick would not admit
this. She had helped the man once, but this was
an exception, and she must have yielded to some very
strong pressure. For all that, Dick hoped his comrade
would not tell Kenwardine much about their trip
in the launch.
</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Jake handled the subject with
some judgment when Kenwardine, who had just finished
his breakfast, gave him coffee in the patio. They
sat beneath the purple creeper while the sunshine crept
down the opposite wall. The air was fresh and the
murmur of the surf came languidly across the flat
roofs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you in town unusually early?&#8221; Kenwardine
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jake with a twinkle, &#8220;you see we got
here late.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Brandon was with you. This makes it obvious
that you spent a perfectly sober night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake laughed. He liked Kenwardine and meant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
to stick to him, but although rash and extravagant,
he was sometimes shrewd, and admitted that there
might perhaps be some ground for Dick&#8217;s suspicions.
He was entitled to lose his own money, but he must
run no risk of injuring his father&#8217;s business. However,
since Kenwardine had a share in the coaling
wharf, he would learn that they had been to Adexe,
and to try to hide this would show that they distrusted
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our occupation was innocent but rather arduous,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;We went to Adexe in the launch to see
when our coal was coming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you get it? The manager told me something
about the tug&#8217;s engines needing repairs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We got one scow that broke adrift off the Tajada
reef. They had to turn back with the others.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then perhaps I&#8217;d better telephone to find out what
they mean to do,&#8221; Kenwardine suggested.
</p>
<p>Jake wondered whether he wished to learn if they
had already made inquiries, and thought frankness
was best.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Brandon called up the wharf as soon as the office
was open, but didn&#8217;t get much information. Something
seemed to be wrong with the wire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose he wanted to know when the coal would
leave?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jake. &#8220;But he began by asking if
the tug had come back safe, and got no further, because
the other fellow couldn&#8217;t hear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why was he anxious about the tug?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kenwardine&#8217;s manner was careless, but Jake
imagined he felt more interest than he showed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was blowing pretty fresh when she left us, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
if the scows had broken adrift again, there&#8217;d have been
some risk of losing them. This would delay the delivery
of the coal, and we&#8217;re getting very short of
fuel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Kenwardine. &#8220;Well, if anything of
the kind had happened, I would have heard of it. You
needn&#8217;t be afraid of not getting a supply.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake waited. He thought it might look significant
if he showed any eagerness to change the subject, but
when Kenwardine began to talk about something else
he followed his lead. Half an hour later he left the
house, feeling that he had used commendable tact, but
determined not to tell Brandon about the interview.
Dick had a habit of exaggerating the importance of
things, and since he already distrusted Kenwardine,
Jake thought it better not to give him fresh ground
for suspicion. There was no use in supplying his
comrade with another reason for preventing his going
to the house.

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>JAKE GETS INTO DIFFICULTIES</h3>
</div>

<p>Day was breaking, though it was still dark at the
foot of the range, when Dick returned wearily
to his iron shack after a night&#8217;s work at the dam.
There had been a local subsidence of the foundations
on the previous afternoon, and he could not leave the
spot until precautions had been taken to prevent the
danger spreading. Bethune came with him to look
at some plans, and on entering the veranda they were
surprised to find the house well lighted and smears of
mud and water upon the floor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks as if a bathing party had been walking
round the shack, and your boy had tried to clean up
when he was half-asleep,&#8221; Bethune said.
</p>
<p>Dick called his colored servant and asked him:
&#8220;Why are all the lights burning, and what&#8217;s this
mess?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Señor Fuller say he no could see the chairs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did he want to see them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He fall on one, señor; t&#8217;row it wit&#8217; mucha force
and fall on it again. Say dozenas of <i>malditos sillas</i>.
If he fall other time, he kill my head.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Dick sharply. &#8220;Where is he now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He go in your bed, señor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What has happened is pretty obvious,&#8221; Bethune
remarked. &#8220;Fuller came home with a big jag on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
and scared this fellow. We&#8217;d better see if he&#8217;s all
right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick took him into his bedroom and the negro followed.
The room was very hot and filled with a
rank smell of kerosene, for the lamp was smoking
and the negro explained that Jake had threatened
him with violence if he turned it down. The lad
lay with a flushed face on Dick&#8217;s bed; his muddy boots
sticking out from under the crumpled coverlet. He
seemed to be fully dressed and his wet clothes were
smeared with foul green slime. There was a big red
lump on his forehead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you put him into his own bed?&#8221; Dick
asked the negro.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He go in, señor, and come out quick. Say no
possible he stop. <i>Maldito</i> bed is damp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bethune smiled. &#8220;There&#8217;ll be a big washbasket
for the <i>lavenderas</i> to-morrow, but we must take his
wet clothes off.&#8221; He shook Jake. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to
wake up!&#8221;
</p>
<p>After a time Jake opened his eyes and blinked at
Bethune. &#8220;All right! You&#8217;re not as fat as Salvador,
and you can catch that chair. The fool thing follows
me and keeps getting in my way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come out,&#8221; Bethune ordered him, and turned to
the negro. &#8220;Where&#8217;s his pyjamas?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Salvador brought a suit, and Dick, who dragged
Jake out of bed, asked: &#8220;How did you get into this
mess?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fell into pond behind the dam; not safe that pond.
Put a shingle up to-morrow, &#8216;Keep off the grass.&#8217;
No, that&#8217;sh not right. Let&#8217;sh try again. &#8216;Twenty
dollars fine if you spit on the sidewalk.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>Bethune grinned at Dick. &#8220;It&#8217;s not an unusual
notice in some of our smaller towns, and one must
admit it&#8217;s necessary. However, we want to get him
into dry clothes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake gave them some trouble, but they put him in
a re-made bed and went back to the verandah, where
Bethune sat down.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuller has his good points, but I guess you find
him something of a responsibility,&#8221; he remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said Dick, with feeling. &#8220;Still, this is
the first time he has come home the worse for liquor.
I&#8217;m rather worried about it, because it&#8217;s a new trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you had enough already?&#8221; Bethune suggested.
&#8220;Well, though you&#8217;re not very old yet, I
think Miss Fuller did well to make you his guardian,
and perhaps I&#8217;m to blame for his relapse, because I
sent him to Santa Brigida. François was busy and
there were a number of bills to pay for stores we
bought in the town. I hope Fuller hasn&#8217;t lost the
money!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick felt disturbed, but he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think so.
Jake&#8217;s erratic, but he&#8217;s surprised me by his prudence
now and then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bethune left soon afterwards, and Dick went to
bed, but got up again after an hour or two and began
his work without seeing Jake. They did not meet
during the day, and Dick went home to his evening
meal uncertain what line to take. He had no real
authority, and finding Jake languid and silent, decided
to say nothing about his escapade. When the
meal was finished, they left the hot room, as usual,
for the verandah, and Jake dropped listlessly into a
canvas chair.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I allow you&#8217;re more tactful than I thought,&#8221; he
remarked with a feeble smile. &#8220;Guess I was pretty
drunk last night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looked rather like it from your clothes and the
upset in the house,&#8221; Dick agreed.
</p>
<p>Jake looked thoughtful. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said ingenuously,
&#8220;I <i>have</i> been on a jag before, but I really don&#8217;t
often indulge in that kind of thing, and don&#8217;t remember
drinking enough to knock me out. You see, Kenwardine&#8217;s
a fastidious fellow and sticks to wine. The
sort he keeps is light.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you got drunk at his house? I&#8217;d sooner
have heard you were at the casino, where the Spaniards
would have turned you out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know the worst yet,&#8221; Jake replied hesitatingly.
&#8220;As I&#8217;m in a very tight place, I&#8217;d better
&#8217;fess up. François doesn&#8217;t seem to have told you
that I tried to draw my pay for some months ahead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Dick, remembering with uneasiness
what he had learned from Bethune. &#8220;That sounds
ominous. Did you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me get it over,&#8221; Jake interrupted. &#8220;Richter
was there, besides a Spanish fellow, and a man called
Black. We&#8217;d been playing cards, and I&#8217;d won a small
pile when my luck began to turn. It wasn&#8217;t long
before I was cleaned out and heavily in debt. Kenwardine
said I&#8217;d had enough and had better quit. I
sometimes think you don&#8217;t quite do the fellow justice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind that,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;I suppose you
didn&#8217;t stop?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I took a drink that braced me up and soon
afterwards thought I saw my chance. The cards
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
looked pretty good, and I put up a big bluff and piled
on all I had.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you had nothing; you&#8217;d lost what you began
with.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake colored. &#8220;Bethune had given me a check to
bearer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was afraid of that,&#8221; Dick said gravely. &#8220;But
go on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I&#8217;d bluff them, but Black and the Spaniard
told me to play, though Kenwardine held back
at first. Said they didn&#8217;t want to take advantage of
my rashness and I couldn&#8217;t make good. Well, I saw
how I could put it over, and it looked as if they couldn&#8217;t
stop me, until Black brought out a trump I didn&#8217;t think
he ought to have. After that I don&#8217;t remember much,
but imagine I turned on the fellow and made some
trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you remember how the cards went?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Dick awkwardly, &#8220;not now, and I may
have been mistaken about the thing. I believe I fell
over the table and they put me on a couch. After a
time, I saw there was nobody in the room, and thought
I&#8217;d better get out.&#8221; He paused and added with a
flush: &#8220;I was afraid Miss Kenwardine might find
me in the morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t pay back the money you lost?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t. The check will show in the works&#8217; accounts
and there&#8217;ll sure be trouble if the old man
hears of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick was silent for a few moments. It was curious
that Jake had tried to defend Kenwardine; but this
did not matter. The lad&#8217;s anxiety and distress were
plain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll leave the thing entirely in my hands, I&#8217;ll
see what can be done,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to tell
Bethune.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do whatever you want, if you&#8217;ll help me out,&#8221;
Jake answered eagerly, and after asking some questions
about his losses, Dick went to Bethune&#8217;s shack.
</p>
<p>Bethune listened thoughtfully to what he had to
say, and then remarked: &#8220;We&#8217;ll take it for granted
that you mean to see him through. Have you enough
money?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; that&#8217;s why I came.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must get the check back, anyhow,&#8221; said
Bethune, who opened a drawer and took out a roll of
paper currency. &#8220;Here&#8217;s my pile, and it&#8217;s at your
service, but it won&#8217;t go far enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it will, with what I can add,&#8221; said Dick,
after counting the bills. &#8220;You see, I don&#8217;t mean to
pay the full amount.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bethune looked at him and smiled. &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s
rather unusual, but if they made him drunk and the
game was not quite straight! Have you got his promise
not to play again?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t. What I&#8217;m going to do will make it
awkward, if not impossible. Besides, he&#8217;ll have no
money. I&#8217;ll stop what he owes out of his pay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A good plan! However, I won&#8217;t lend you the
money; I&#8217;ll lend it Jake, which makes him responsible.
But your pay&#8217;s less than mine, and you&#8217;ll have
to economize for the next few months.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t matter,&#8221; Dick answered quietly. &#8220;I
owe Fuller something, and I like the lad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went back to his shack and said to Jake, &#8220;We&#8217;ll
be able to clear off the debt, but you must ask no questions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
and agree to any arrangement I think it best to
make.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a good sort,&#8221; Jake said with feeling; but
Dick cut short his thanks and went off to bed.
</p>
<p>Next morning he started for Santa Brigida, and
when he reached Kenwardine&#8217;s house met Clare on a
balcony at the top of the outside stairs. Somewhat
to his surprise, she stopped him with a sign, and then
stood silent for a moment, looking disturbed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Brandon,&#8221; she said hesitatingly, &#8220;I resented
your trying to prevent Mr. Fuller coming here, but
I now think it better that he should keep away. He&#8217;s
young and extravagant, and perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Dick, who felt sympathetic, knowing
what her admission must have cost. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid
he&#8217;s also rather unsteady.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare looked at him with some color in her face.
&#8220;I must be frank. Something happened recently that
showed me he oughtn&#8217;t to come. I don&#8217;t think I
realized this before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you know what happened?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not altogether,&#8221; Clare replied. &#8220;But I learned
enough to alarm and surprise me. You must understand
that I didn&#8217;t suspect&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She paused with
signs of confusion and then resumed: &#8220;Of course,
people of different kinds visit my father on business,
and sometimes stay an hour or two afterwards, and
he really can&#8217;t be held responsible for them. The customs
of the country force him to be friendly; you know
in Santa Brigida one&#8217;s office is something like an English
club. Well, a man who doesn&#8217;t come often began
a game of cards and when Mr. Fuller&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; said Dick as quietly as he could. &#8220;Jake&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
rash and not to be trusted when there are cards about;
indeed, I expect he&#8217;s a good deal to blame, but I&#8217;m
now going to ask your father not to encourage
his visits. I&#8217;ve no doubt he&#8217;ll see the reason for
this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll help you when he understands,&#8221;
Clare replied, and after giving Dick a grateful look
moved away.
</p>
<p>Dick went along the balcony, thinking hard. It
was obvious that Clare had found the interview painful,
though he had tried to make it easier for her.
She had been alarmed, but he wondered whether she
had given him the warning out of tenderness for Jake.
It was probable that she really thought Kenwardine
was not to blame, but it must have been hard to acknowledge
that his house was a dangerous place for
an extravagant lad. Still, a girl might venture much
when fighting for her lover. Dick frowned as he admitted
this. Jake was a good fellow in spite of certain
faults, but it was disturbing to think that Clare
might be in love with him.
</p>
<p>It was something of a relief when Kenwardine met
him at the door of his room and took him in. Dick
felt that tact was not so needful now, because the hospitality
shown him was counterbalanced by the theft
of the plans, and he held Kenwardine, not Clare, accountable
for this. Kenwardine indicated a chair, and
then sat down.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As you haven&#8217;t been here since you got better, I
imagine there&#8217;s some particular reason for this call,&#8221;
he said, with a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is so,&#8221; Dick agreed. &#8220;I&#8217;ve come on Fuller&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
behalf. He gave you a check the other night. Have
you cashed it yet?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I imagined he might want to redeem it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He does; but, to begin with, I&#8217;d like to know how
much he lost before he staked the check. I understand
he increased the original stakes during the
game.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say I could tell you, but I don&#8217;t see your
object.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll explain it soon. We can&#8217;t get on until I know
the sum.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kenwardine took a small, card-scoring book from
a drawer, and after a few moments stated the amount
Jake had lost.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;I&#8217;ll pay you the money
now in exchange for the check.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But he lost the check as well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick hesitated. He had a repugnant part to play,
since he must accuse the man who had taken him into
his house when he was wounded of conspiring to rob
a drunken lad. For all that, his benefactor&#8217;s son
should not be ruined, and he meant to separate him
from Kenwardine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; he answered coolly. &#8220;But suppose
we let that go? The check is worthless, because payment
can be stopped, but I&#8217;m willing to give you what
Fuller had already lost.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kenwardine raised his eyebrows in ironical surprise.
&#8220;This is a somewhat extraordinary course. Is
Mr. Fuller in the habit of disowning his debts? You
know the rule about a loss at cards.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuller has left the thing in my hands, and you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
must hold me responsible. I mean to stick to the line
I&#8217;ve taken.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then perhaps you won&#8217;t mind explaining on what
grounds you take it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Since you insist! Fuller was drunk when he made
the bet. As you were his host, it was your duty to
stop the game.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The exact point when an excited young man ceases
to be sober is remarkably hard to fix,&#8221; Kenwardine
answered dryly. &#8220;It would be awkward for the host
if he fixed it too soon, and insulting to the guest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a risk you should have taken. For another
thing, Fuller states that a trump was played
by a man who ought not to have had it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kenwardine smiled. &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it strike you that
you&#8217;re urging conflicting reasons? First you declare
that Fuller was drunk, and then that he was able to
detect clever players at cheating. Your argument contradicts
itself and is plainly absurd.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow, I mean to urge it,&#8221; Dick said doggedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Kenwardine with a steady look, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
no doubt you see what this implies. You charge me
with a plot to intoxicate your friend and take a mean
advantage of his condition.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I don&#8217;t go so far. I think you should have
stopped the game, but Fuller accuses a man called
Black of playing the wrong card. In fact, I admit
that you don&#8217;t mean to harm him, by taking it for
granted that you&#8217;ll let me have the check, because if
you kept it, you&#8217;d have some hold on him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A firm hold,&#8221; Kenwardine remarked.
</p>
<p>Dick had partly expected this, and had his answer
ready. &#8220;Not so firm as you think. If there was no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
other way, it would force me to stop payment and
inform my employer. It would be much better that
Jake should have to deal with his father than with
your friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to have thought over the matter carefully,&#8221;
Kenwardine rejoined. &#8220;Well, personally, I&#8217;m
willing to accept your offer and give up the check;
but I must consult the others, since their loss is as
much as mine. Will you wait while I go to the telephone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick waited for some time, after which Kenwardine
came back and gave him the check. As soon as he
got it Dick left the house, satisfied because he had
done what he had meant to do, and yet feeling doubtful.
Kenwardine had given way too easily. It
looked as if he was not convinced that he must leave
Fuller alone.
</p>
<p>On reaching the dam Dick gave Jake the check and
told him how he had got it. The lad flushed angrily,
but was silent for a moment, and then gave Dick a
curious look.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t deny your generosity, and I&#8217;ll pay you
back; but you see the kind of fellow you make me
out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told Kenwardine you left me to deal with the
matter, and the plan was mine,&#8221; said Dick.
</p>
<p>Jake signified by a gesture that the subject must
be dropped. &#8220;As I did agree to leave it to you, I
can&#8217;t object. After all, I expect you meant well.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE BLACK-FUNNEL BOAT</h3>
</div>

<p>The breeze had fallen and the shining sea was
smooth as glass when the launch passed Adexe.
Dick, who lounged at the helm, was not going there.
Some alterations to a mole along the coast had just
been finished, and Stuyvesant had sent him to engage
the contractor who had done the concrete work. Jake,
who occasionally found his duties irksome, had insisted
on coming.
</p>
<p>As they crossed the mouth of the inlet, Dick glanced
shorewards through his glasses. The whitewashed
coal-sheds glistened dazzlingly, and a fringe of snowy
surf marked the curve of beach, but outside this a
belt of cool, blue water extended to the wharf. The
swell surged to and fro among the piles, checkered
with purple shadows and laced with threads of foam,
but it was the signs of human activity that occupied
Dick&#8217;s attention. He noticed the cloud of dust that
rolled about the mounds of coal upon the wharf and
blurred the figures of the toiling peons, and the way
the tubs swung up and down from the hatches of an
American collier until the rattle of her winches suddenly
broke off.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They seem to be doing a big business,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;It looks as if that boat had stopped discharging,
but she must have landed a large quantity
of coal.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s pretty good shelter at Adexe,&#8221; Jake replied.
&#8220;In ordinary weather, steamers can come up
to the wharf, instead of lying a quarter of a mile off,
as they do at Santa Brigida. However, there&#8217;s not
much cargo shipped, and a captain who wanted his
bunkers filled would have to make a special call with
little chance of picking up any freight. That must
tell against the place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were not steaming fast, and just before a projecting
point shut in the inlet the deep blast of a
whistle rang across the water and the collier&#8217;s dark
hull swung out from the wharf. A streak of foam,
cut sharply between her black side and the shadowed
blue of the sea, marked her load-line, and she floated
high, but not as if she were empty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Going on somewhere else to finish, I guess,&#8221; said
Jake. &#8220;How much do you reckon she has discharged?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifteen hundred tons, if she was full when she
came in, and I imagine they hadn&#8217;t much room in the
sheds before. I wonder where Kenwardine gets the
money, unless his friend, Richter, is rich.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Richter has nothing to do with the business,&#8221; Jake
replied. &#8220;He was to have had a share, but they
couldn&#8217;t come to a satisfactory agreement.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick looked at him sharply. &#8220;How do you
know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t know much. Kenwardine said
something about it one night when I was at his house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did somebody ask him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jake, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think so. The subject,
so to speak, cropped up and he offered us the information.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>Then he talked of something else and soon afterwards
the coast receded as they crossed a wide bay.
It was about four o&#8217;clock in the afternoon when they
reached the farthest point from land. There was no
wind, and in the foreground the sea ran in long undulations
whose backs blazed with light. Farther off,
the gentle swell was smoothed out and became an
oily expanse that faded into the glitter on the horizon,
but at one point the latter was faintly blurred. A
passing vessel, Dick thought, and occupied himself
with the engine, for he had not brought the fireman.
Looking round some time afterwards, he saw that
the ship had got more distinct and picked up his
glasses.
</p>
<p>She was a two-masted steamer and, cut off by the
play of reflected light, floated like a mirage between
sky and sea. After studying her for a minute, Dick
gave Jake the glasses.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a curious effect, but not uncommon on a day
like this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She&#8217;s like the big Spanish boats
and has their tall black funnel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s very like them,&#8221; Jake agreed. &#8220;There&#8217;s no
smoke, and no wash about her. It looks as if they&#8217;d
had some trouble in the engine-room and she&#8217;d
stopped.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick nodded and glanced across the dazzling water
towards the high, blue coast. He did not think the
steamer could be seen from the land, and the launch
would, no doubt, be invisible from her deck, but this
was not important and he began to calculate how long
it would take them to reach a point ahead. Some
time later, he looked round again. The steamer was
fading in the distance, but no smoke trailed behind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
her and he did not think she had started yet. His attention,
however, was occupied by the headland he was
steering for, because he thought it marked the neighborhood
of their port.
</p>
<p>He spent an hour in the place before he finished his
business and started home, and when they were about
half-way across the bay the light began to fade. The
sun had sunk and the high land cut, harshly blue,
against a saffron glow; the sea was shadowy and
colorless in the east. Presently Jake, who sat facing
aft, called out:
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a steamer&#8217;s masthead light coming up
astern of us. Now I see her side lights, and by the
distance between them she&#8217;s a big boat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick changed his course, because the steamer&#8217;s three
lights would not have been visible unless she was directly
following him and the launch&#8217;s small yellow
funnel and dingy white topsides would be hard to distinguish.
When he had shut out one of the colored
side lights and knew he was safe, he stopped the engine
to wait until the vessel passed. There was no
reason why he should do so, but somehow he felt interested
in the ship. Lighting his pipe, he studied
her through the glasses, which he gave to Jake.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s the boat we saw before,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; Jake agreed. &#8220;Her engines are all
right now because she&#8217;s steaming fast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick nodded, for he had marked the mass of foam
that curled and broke away beneath the vessel&#8217;s bow,
but Jake resumed: &#8220;It looks as if her dynamo had
stopped. There&#8217;s nothing to be seen but her navigation
lights and she&#8217;s certainly a passenger boat. They
generally glitter like a gin-saloon.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>The ship was getting close now and Dick, who
asked for the glasses, examined her carefully as she
came up, foreshortened, on their quarter. Her dark
bow looked very tall and her funnel loomed, huge
and shadowy, against the sky. Above its top the
masthead light shed a yellow glimmer, and far below,
the sea leapt and frothed about the line of hull.
This drew out and lengthened as she came abreast
of them, but now he could see the tiers of passenger
decks, one above the other, there was something mysterious
in the gloom that reigned on board. No ring
of light pierced her long dark side and the gangways
behind the rails and rows of stanchions looked like
shadowy caves. In the open spaces, forward and aft,
however, bodies of men were gathered, their clothes
showing faintly white, but they stood still in a compact
mass until a whistle blew and the indistinct figures
scattered across the deck.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A big crew,&#8221; Jake remarked. &#8220;Guess they&#8217;ve
been putting them through a boat or fire drill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick did not answer, but when the vessel faded into
a hazy mass ahead he started the engine and steered
into her eddying wake, which ran far back into the
dark. Then after a glance at the compass, he beckoned
Jake. &#8220;Look how she&#8217;s heading.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake told him and he nodded. &#8220;I made it half a
point more to port, but this compass swivels rather
wildly. Where do you think she&#8217;s bound?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To Santa Brigida; but, as you can see, not direct.
I expect her skipper wants to take a bearing from the
Adexe lights. You are going there and her course is
the same as ours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Dick; &#8220;I&#8217;m edging in towards the land
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
rather short of Adexe. As we have the current on
our bow, I want to get hold of the beach as soon as
I can, for the sake of slacker water. Anyway, a big
boat would keep well clear of the shore until she passed
the Tajada reef.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then she may be going into Adexe for coal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That vessel wouldn&#8217;t float alongside the wharf,
and her skipper would sooner fill his bunkers where
he&#8217;d get passengers and freight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I expect we&#8217;ll find her at Santa Brigida when
we arrive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They looked round, but the sea was now dark and
empty and they let the matter drop. When they
crossed the Adexe bight no steamer was anchored
near, but a cluster of lights on the dusky beach marked
the coaling wharf.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re working late,&#8221; Dick said. &#8220;Can you see
the tug?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d have to run close in before you could do
so,&#8221; Jake replied. &#8220;I expect they&#8217;re trimming the
coal the collier landed into the sheds.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s possible,&#8221; Dick agreed, and after hesitating
for a few moments held on his course. He remembered
that one can hear a launch&#8217;s engines and the
splash of torn-up water for some distance on a calm
night.
</p>
<p>After a time, the lights of Santa Brigida twinkled
ahead, and when they steamed up to the harbor both
looked about. The American collier and a big cargo-boat
lay with the reflections of their anchor-lights
quivering on the swell, but there was no passenger
liner to be seen. A man came to moor the launch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
when they landed, and Jake asked if the vessel he described
had called.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, señor,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;The only boats I
know like that are the Cadiz liners, and the next is not
due for a fortnight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Her model&#8217;s a pretty common one for big passenger
craft,&#8221; Jake remarked to Dick as they went
up the mole. &#8220;Still, the thing&#8217;s curious. She wasn&#8217;t
at Adexe and she hasn&#8217;t been here. She certainly
passed us, steering for the land, and I don&#8217;t see where
she could have gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick began to talk about something else, but next
morning asked Stuyvesant for a day&#8217;s leave. Stuyvesant
granted it and Dick resumed: &#8220;Do you mind
giving me a blank order form? I&#8217;m going to Adexe,
and the storekeeper wants a few things we can&#8217;t get in
Santa Brigida.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stuyvesant signed the form. &#8220;There it is. The
new coaling people seem an enterprising crowd, and
you can order anything they can supply.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick hired a mule and took the steep inland road;
but on reaching Adexe went first to the sugar mill and
spent an hour with the American engineer, whose acquaintance
he had made. Then, having, as he thought,
accounted for his visit, he went to the wharf and
carefully looked about as he made his way to the manager&#8217;s
office.
</p>
<p>A few grimy peons were brushing coal-dust off the
planks, their thinly-clad forms silhouetted against the
shining sea. Their movements were languid, and Dick
wondered whether this was due to the heat or if it
was accounted for by forced activity on the previous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
night. A neatly built stack of coal stood beside the
whitewashed sheds, but nothing suggested that it had
been recently broken into. Passing it carelessly Dick
glanced into the nearest shed, which was almost full,
though its proximity to deep water indicated that
supplies would be drawn from it before the other.
Feeling rather puzzled, he stopped in front of the
next shed and noted that there was much less coal in
this. Moreover, a large number of empty bags lay
near the entrance, as if they had been used recently
and the storekeeper had not had time to put them
away.
</p>
<p>Two men were folding up the bags, but, by contrast
with the glitter outside, the shed was dark, and
Dick&#8217;s eyes were not accustomed to the gloom. Still
he thought one of the men was Oliva, the contractor
whom Stuyvesant had dismissed. Next moment the
fellow turned and threw a folded bag aside, after
which he walked towards the other end of the shed.
His movements were leisurely, but he kept his back
to Dick and the latter thought this significant, although
he was not sure the man had seen him.
</p>
<p>As he did not want to be seen loitering about the
sheds, he walked on, feeling puzzled. Since he did
not know what stock the company had held, it was
difficult to tell if coal had recently been shipped, but
he imagined that some must have left the wharf after
the collier had unloaded. He was used to calculating
weights and cubic quantities, and the sheds were not
large. Taking it for granted that the vessel had
landed one thousand five hundred tons, he thought
there ought to be more about than he could see. Still,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
if some had been shipped, he could not understand
why it had been taken, at a greater cost for labor, from
the last shed, where one would expect the company
to keep their reserve supply. He might, perhaps, find
out something from the manager, but this would need
tact.
</p>
<p>Entering the small, hot office, he found a suave
Spanish gentleman whom he had already met. The
latter greeted him politely and gave him a cigar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not often you leave the works, but a change
is good,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not quite so busy and I promised to pay
Allen at the sugar mill a visit,&#8221; Dick replied. &#8220;Besides,
I had an excuse for the trip. We&#8217;re short of
some engine stores that I dare say you can let us
have.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He gave the manager a list, and the Spaniard nodded
as he marked the items.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can send you most of the things. It pays us
to stock goods that the engineers of the ships we coal
often want; but there are some we have not got.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;I&#8217;ll fill up our form for
what you have and you can put the things on board
the tug the first time she goes to Santa Brigida.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She will go in three or four days.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick decided that as the launch had probably been
seen, he had better mention his voyage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That will be soon enough. If our storekeeper had
told me earlier, I would have called here yesterday.
I passed close by on my way to Orava.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the peons saw your boat. It is some distance
to Orava.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The sea was very smooth,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;I went
to engage a contractor who had been at work upon the
mole.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So far, conversation had been easy, and he had
satisfactorily accounted for his passing the wharf, without,
he hoped, appearing anxious to do so; but he had
learned nothing yet, although he thought the Spaniard
was more interested in his doings than he looked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The collier was leaving as we went by,&#8221; he resumed.
&#8220;Trade must be good, because she seemed
to have unloaded a large quantity of coal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sixteen hundred tons,&#8221; said the manager. &#8220;In
war time, when freights advance, it is wise to keep a
good stock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As this was very nearly the quantity Dick had
guessed, he noted the man&#8217;s frankness, but somehow
imagined it was meant to hide something.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So long as you can sell the stock,&#8221; he agreed.
&#8220;War, however, interferes with trade, and the French
line have reduced their sailings, while I expect the
small British tramps won&#8217;t be so numerous.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They have nothing to fear in these waters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose they haven&#8217;t, and vessels belonging to
neutral countries ought to be safe,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;Still,
the Spanish company seem to have changed their sailings,
because I thought I saw one of their boats yesterday;
but she was a long way off on the horizon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He thought the other gave him a keen glance, but
as the shutters were partly closed the light was not
good, and the man answered carelessly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;They do not deal with us. Adexe is off their
course and no boats so large can come up to the
wharf.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Dick, who believed he had admitted
enough to disarm any suspicion the other might have
entertained, &#8220;doesn&#8217;t coal that&#8217;s kept exposed to the
air lose some of its heating properties?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It does not suffer much damage. But we will
drink a glass of wine, and then I will show you how
we keep our coal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks. These things interest me, but I looked
into the sheds as I passed,&#8221; Dick answered as he drank
his wine.
</p>
<p>They went out and when they entered the first shed
the Spaniard called a peon and gave him an order
Dick did not catch. Then he showed Dick the cranes,
and the trucks that ran along the wharf on rails, and
how they weighed the bags of coal. After a time
they went into a shed that was nearly empty and Dick
carefully looked about. Several peons were at work
upon the bags, but Oliva was not there. Dick wondered
whether he had been warned to keep out of
sight.
</p>
<p>As they went back to the office, his companion
looked over the edge of the wharf and spoke to a
seaman on the tug below. Her fires were out and
the hammering that came up through the open skylights
indicated that work was being done in her engine-room.
Then one of the workmen seemed to object
to something another said, for Dick heard &#8220;No;
it must be tightened. It knocked last night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He knew enough Castilian to feel sure he had not
been mistaken, and the meaning of what he had heard
was plain. A shaft-journal knocks when the bearings
it revolves in have worn or shaken loose, and the
machinery must have been running when the engineer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
heard the noise. Dick thought it better to light a
cigarette, and was occupied shielding the match with
his hands when the manager turned round. A few
minutes later he stated that as it was a long way to
Santa Brigida he must start soon and after some Spanish
compliments the other let him go.
</p>
<p>He followed the hill road slowly in a thoughtful
mood. The manager had been frank, but Dick suspected
him of trying to show that he had nothing to
hide. Then he imagined that a quantity of coal had
been shipped since the previous day, and if the tug
had been at sea at night, she must have been used for
towing lighters. The large vessel he had seen was
obviously a passenger boat, but fast liners could be
converted into auxiliary cruisers. There were, however,
so far as he knew, no enemy cruisers in the neighborhood;
indeed, it was supposed that they had been
chased off the seas. Still, there was something mysterious
about the matter, and he meant to watch the
coaling company and Kenwardine.

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>DICK GETS A WARNING</h3>
</div>

<p>On the evening of one pay-day, Dick took a short
cut through the half-breed quarter of Santa
Brigida. As not infrequently happens in old Spanish
cities, this unsavory neighborhood surrounded the
cathedral and corresponded in character with the localities
known in western America as &#8220;across the
track.&#8221; Indeed, a Castilian proverb bluntly plays
upon the juxtaposition of vice and bells.
</p>
<p>Ancient houses rose above the dark and narrow
street. Flakes of plaster had fallen from their blank
walls, the archways that pierced them were foul and
strewn with refuse, and a sour smell of decay and
garbage tainted the stagnant air. Here and there a
grossly fat, slatternly woman leaned upon the rails of
an outside balcony; negroes, Chinamen, and half-breeds
passed along the broken pavements; and the
dirty, open-fronted wine-shops, where swarms of flies
hovered about the tables, were filled with loungers of
different shades of color.
</p>
<p>By and by Dick noticed a man in clean white duck
on the opposite side of the street. He was a short
distance in front, but his carriage and the fit of his
clothes indicated that he was a white man and probably
an American, and Dick slackened his pace. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
imagined that the other would sooner not be found
in that neighborhood if he happened to be an acquaintance.
The fellow, however, presently crossed
the street, and when he stopped and looked about,
Dick, meeting him face to face, saw with some surprise
that it was Kemp, the fireman, who had shown
him an opportunity of escaping from the steamer that
took them South.
</p>
<p>Kemp had turned out a steady, sober man, and
Dick, who had got him promoted, wondered what he
was doing there, though he reflected that his own presence
in the disreputable locality was liable to be misunderstood.
Kemp, however, looked at him with a
twinkle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re making for the harbor, Mr. Brandon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick said he was, and Kemp studied the surrounding
houses.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he resumed, &#8220;I&#8217;m certainly up against it
now. I don&#8217;t know much Spanish, and these fool
dagos can&#8217;t talk American, while they&#8217;re packed so
tight in their blamed tenements that it&#8217;s curious they
don&#8217;t fall out of the windows. It&#8217;s a tough proposition
to locate a man here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re looking for somebody?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;ve tracked Payne to this <i>calle</i>, but I guess
there&#8217;s some trailing down to be done yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Dick; for Payne was the dismissed
storekeeper. &#8220;Why do you want him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I met him a while back and he&#8217;d struck bad luck,
hurt his arm, for one thing. He&#8217;d been working
among the breeds on the mole and living in their tenements,
and couldn&#8217;t strike another job. I reckoned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
he might want a few dollars, and I don&#8217;t spend all my
pay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick nodded, because he understood the unfortunate
position of the white man who loses caste in a
tropical country. An Englishman or American may
engage in manual labor where skill is required and the
pay is high, but he must live up to the standards of
his countrymen. If forced to work with natives and
adopt their mode of life, he risks being distrusted and
avoided by men of his color. Remembering that
Payne had interfered when he was stabbed, Dick had
made some inquiries about him, but getting no information
decided that he had left the town.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he&#8217;s lodging in this street,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what they told me at the wine-shop. He
had to quit the last place because he couldn&#8217;t pay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t he with Oliva?&#8221; Dick inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was, but Oliva turned him down. I allow it
was all right to fire him, but he&#8217;s surely up against it
now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick put his hand in his pocket. &#8220;If you find him,
you might let me know. In the meantime, here&#8217;s five
dollars&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; said Kemp. &#8220;Don&#8217;t take out your
wallet here. I&#8217;ll fix the thing, and ask for the money
when I get back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick left him, and when he had transacted his business
returned to the dam. An hour or two later Kemp
arrived and stated that he had not succeeded in finding
Payne. The man had left the squalid room he occupied
and nobody knew where he had gone.
</p>
<p>During the next week Dick had again occasion to
visit the harbor, and while he waited on the mole for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
a boat watched a gang of peons unloading some fertilizer
from a barge. It was hard and unpleasant
work, for the stuff, which had a rank smell, escaped
from the bags and covered the perspiring men. The
dust stuck to their hot faces, almost hiding their color;
but one, though equally dirty, looked different from
the rest, and Dick, noting that he only used his left
arm, drew nearer. As he did so, the man walked up
the steep plank from the lighter with a bag upon his
back and staggering across the mole dropped it with
a gasp. His heaving chest and set face showed what
the effort had cost, and the smell of the fertilizer hung
about his ragged clothes. Dick saw that it was Payne
and that the fellow knew him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have got a rough job,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
you find something better?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; said the man grimly. &#8220;Do you reckon
I&#8217;d pack dirt with a crowd like this if I could help
it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick, who glanced at the lighter, where half-naked
negroes and mulattos were at work amid a cloud of
nauseating dust, understood the social degradation the
other felt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with your arm?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>Payne pulled up his torn sleeve and showed an inflamed
and half-healed wound.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That! Got it nipped in a crane-wheel and it
doesn&#8217;t get much better. Guess this dirt is poisonous.
Anyway, it keeps me here. I&#8217;ve been trying to make
enough to buy a ticket to Jamaica, but can&#8217;t work
steady. As soon as I&#8217;ve put up two or three dollars,
I have to quit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick could understand this. The man looked gaunt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
and ill and must have been heavily handicapped by his
injured arm. He did not seem anxious to excite
Dick&#8217;s pity, though the latter did not think he cherished
much resentment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried to find you when I got better after being
stabbed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t quite see why you came
to my help.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Payne grinned sourly. &#8220;You certainly hadn&#8217;t
much of a claim; but you were a white man and that
dago meant to kill. Now if I&#8217;d held my job with
Fuller and you hadn&#8217;t dropped on to Oliva&#8217;s game,
I&#8217;d have made my little pile; but I allow you had to
fire us when something put you wise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Dick, with a smile at the fellow&#8217;s candor.
&#8220;Well, I couldn&#8217;t trust you with the cement
again, but we&#8217;re short of a man to superintend a peon
gang and I&#8217;ll talk to Mr. Stuyvesant about it if you&#8217;ll
tell me your address.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Payne gave him a fixed, eager look. &#8220;You get me
the job and take me out of this and you won&#8217;t be sorry.
I&#8217;ll make it good to you&mdash;and I reckon I can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick, who thought the other&#8217;s anxiety to escape
from his degrading occupation had prompted his last
statement, turned away, saying he would see what
could be done, and in the evening visited Stuyvesant.
Bethune was already with him, and Dick told them
how he had found Payne.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You felt you had to promise the fellow a job because
he butted in when the dagos got after you?&#8221;
Stuyvesant suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Dick with some embarrassment, &#8220;it
wasn&#8217;t altogether that. He certainly did help me, but
I can&#8217;t pass my obligations on to my employer. If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
you think he can&#8217;t be trusted, I&#8217;ll pay his passage to
another port.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know that if I had the option I&#8217;d
take the fellow out of jail, so long as he was shut up
decently out of sight; but this is worse, in a way.
What do you think, Bethune?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bethune smiled. &#8220;You ought to know. I&#8217;m a bit
of a philosopher, but when you stir my racial feelings
I&#8217;m an American first. The mean white&#8217;s a troublesome
proposition at home, but we can&#8217;t afford to
exhibit him to the dagos here.&#8221; He turned to Dick.
&#8220;That&#8217;s our attitude, Brandon, and though you were
not long in our country, you seem to sympathize with
it. I don&#8217;t claim it&#8217;s quite logical, but there it is!
We&#8217;re white and <i>different</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want me to hire the man?&#8221; Stuyvesant
asked with an impatient gesture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Dick.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then put him on. If he steals anything, I&#8217;ll hold
you responsible and ship him out on the next cement
boat, whether he wants to go or not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Next morning Dick sent word to Payne, who arrived
at the dam soon afterwards and did his work
satisfactorily. On the evening of the first pay-day
he went to Santa Brigida, but Dick, who watched him
in the morning, noted somewhat to his surprise, that
he showed no signs of dissipation. When work
stopped at noon he heard a few pistol shots, but was
told on inquiring that it was only one or two of the
men shooting at a mark. A few days afterwards he
found it necessary to visit Santa Brigida. Since
Bethune confined his talents to constructional problems
and languidly protested that he had no aptitude for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
commerce, much of the company&#8217;s minor business
gradually fell into Dick&#8217;s hands. As a rule, he went
to the town in the evening, after he had finished at
the dam. While a hand-car was being got ready to
take him down the line, Payne came up to the veranda,
where Dick sat with Jake.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going down town, Mr. Brandon,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Have you got a gun?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not,&#8221; said Dick.
</p>
<p>Payne pulled out an automatic pistol. &#8220;Then
you&#8217;d better take mine. I bought her, second-hand,
with my first pay, but she&#8217;s pretty good. I reckon
you can shoot?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A little,&#8221; said Dick, who had practised with the
British army revolver. &#8220;Still I don&#8217;t carry a pistol.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought,&#8221; Payne answered meaningly, and walking
to the other end of the veranda stuck a scrap of
white paper on a post. &#8220;Say, suppose you try her?
I want to see you put a pill through that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick was surprised by the fellow&#8217;s persistence, but
there is a fascination in shooting at a target, and when
Jake urged him he took the pistol. Steadying it with
stiffened wrist and forearm, he fired but hit the post
a foot below the paper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t allowed for the pull-off, and you&#8217;re
slow,&#8221; Payne remarked. &#8220;You want to sight high,
with a squeeze on the trigger, and then catch her on
the drop.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He took the pistol and fixed his eyes on the paper
before he moved. Then his arm went up suddenly
and the glistening barrel pointed above the mark.
There was a flash as his wrist dropped and a black
spot appeared near the middle of the paper.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Use her like that! You&#8217;d want a mighty steady
hand to hold her dead on the mark while you pull
off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down and tell us why you think Mr. Brandon
ought to have the pistol,&#8221; Jake remarked. &#8220;I go to
Santa Brigida now and then, but you haven&#8217;t offered
to lend it me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Payne sat down on the steps and looked at him with
a smile. &#8220;You&#8217;re all right, Mr. Fuller. They&#8217;re not
after you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you reckon it wasn&#8217;t me they wanted the
night my partner was stabbed? I had the money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; said Payne firmly. &#8220;I allow they&#8217;d have
corralled the dollars if they could, but it was Mr.
Brandon they meant to knock out.&#8221; He paused and
added in a significant tone: &#8220;They&#8217;re after him yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you better tell us whom you mean by
&#8216;they&#8217;?&#8221; Dick asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oliva&#8217;s gang. There are toughs in the city who&#8217;d
kill you for fifty cents.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does that account for your buying the pistol when
you came here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It does,&#8221; Payne admitted dryly. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean
to take any chances when it looked as if I was going
back on my dago partner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He turned you down first, and I don&#8217;t see how you
could harm him by working for us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Payne did not answer, and Dick, who thought he
was pondering something, resumed: &#8220;These half-breeds
are a revengeful lot, but after all, Oliva
wouldn&#8217;t run a serious risk without a stronger motive
than he seems to have.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Payne, &#8220;if I talked Spanish, I could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
tell you more; but I was taking my siesta one day in
a dark wine-shop when two or three hard-looking
peons came in. They mayn&#8217;t have seen me, because
there were some casks in the way, and anyhow, they&#8217;d
reckon I couldn&#8217;t understand them. I didn&#8217;t very
well, but I heard your name and caught a word or
two. Their <i>patron</i> had given them some orders and
one called him Don Ramon. You were to be watched,
because <i>mirar</i> came in; but I didn&#8217;t get the rest and
they went out soon. I lay as if I was asleep, but I&#8217;d
know the crowd again.&#8221; Payne got up as he concluded:
&#8220;Anyway, you take my gun, and keep in
the main <i>calles</i>, where the lights are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When he had gone Jake remarked: &#8220;I guess his
advice is good and I&#8217;m coming along.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Dick, smiling as he put the pistol in his
pocket. &#8220;The trouble is that if I took you down there
I mightn&#8217;t get you back. Besides, there are some calculations
I want you to make.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lighting his pipe, he took his seat on the hand-car
and knitted his brows as two colored laborers drove
him down the hill. Below, the lights of Santa Brigida
gleamed in a cluster against the dusky sea, and he
knew something of the intrigues that went on in the
town. Commercial and political jealousies were very
keen, and citizens of all ranks fought and schemed
against their neighbors. The place was rank with
plots, but it was hard to see how he could be involved.
Yet it certainly began to look as if he had been stabbed
by Oliva&#8217;s order, and Oliva was now employed at the
Adexe coaling wharf.
</p>
<p>This seemed to throw a light upon the matter.
Something mysterious was going on at Adexe, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
perhaps he had been incautious and had shown his
suspicions; the Spaniards were subtle. The manager
might have imagined he knew more than he did; but
if it was worth defending by the means Payne had
hinted at, the secret must be very important, and
the plotters would hesitate about betraying themselves
by another attempt upon his life so long as there was
any possibility of failure. Besides, it was dangerous
to attack a foreigner, since if he were killed, the representative
of his country would demand an exhaustive
inquiry.
</p>
<p>While Dick pondered the matter the hand-car
stopped and he alighted and walked briskly to Santa
Brigida, keeping in the middle of the road. When he
reached the town, he chose the wide, well-lighted
streets but saw nothing suspicious. After transacting
his business he ventured, by way of experiment, across
a small dark square and returned to the main street
by a narrow lane, but although he kept a keen watch
nothing indicated that he was followed. Reaching
the hand-car without being molested, he determined to
be cautious in future, though it was possible that Payne
had been deceived.

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>JAKE EXPLAINS MATTERS</h3>
</div>

<p>The sun had sunk behind the range when Clare
Kenwardine stood, musing, on a balcony of the
house. Voices and footsteps reached her across the
roofs, for Santa Brigida was wakening from its afternoon
sleep and the traffic had begun again in the cooling
streets. The girl listened vacantly, as she grappled
with questions that had grown more troublesome
of late.
</p>
<p>The life she led often jarred, and yet she could find
no escape. She hoped she was not unnecessarily censorious
and tried to argue that after all there was no
great harm in gambling, but rarely succeeded in convincing
herself. Then she had deliberately thrown
in her lot with her father&#8217;s. When she first insisted
on joining him in England, he had, for her sake, as
she now realized, discouraged the plan, but had since
come to depend upon her in many ways, and she could
not leave him. Besides, it was too late. She had
made her choice and must stick to it.
</p>
<p>Yet she rebelled against the feeling that she had
brought a taint or stigma upon herself. She had no
women friends except the wives of one or two Spanish
officials whose reputation for honesty was not of the
best; the English and American women left her alone.
Most of the men she met she frankly disliked, and imagined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
that the formal respect they showed her was
due to her father&#8217;s hints. Kenwardine&#8217;s moral code
was not severe, but he saw that his guests preserved
their manners. Clare had heard the Spaniards call
him <i>muy caballero</i>, and they knew the outward points
of a gentleman. While she pondered, he came out on
the balcony.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Brooding?&#8221; he said with a smile. &#8220;Well, it has
been very dull lately and we need cheering up. Suppose
you send Mr. Fuller a note and ask him to dinner
to-morrow? He&#8217;s sometimes amusing and I think you
like him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare braced herself for a struggle, for it was seldom
she refused her father&#8217;s request.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I like him, but it would be better
if he didn&#8217;t come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kenwardine gave her a keen glance, but although
he felt some surprise did not try to hide his understanding
of what she meant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks as if you knew something about what happened
on his last visit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; Clare answered. &#8220;It was rather a shock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One mustn&#8217;t exaggerate the importance of these
things,&#8221; Kenwardine remarked in an indulgent tone.
&#8220;It&#8217;s difficult to avoid getting a jar now and then,
though I&#8217;ve tried to shield you as much as possible.
Fuller&#8217;s young and high-spirited, and you really
mustn&#8217;t judge his youthful extravagance too severely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you see you are admitting that he
shouldn&#8217;t come?&#8221; Clare asked, with some color in her
face. &#8220;He <i>is</i> young and inexperienced, and your
friends are men of the world. What is safe for them
may be dangerous for him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>Kenwardine pondered. Fuller was an attractive
lad, and he would not have been displeased to think
that Clare&#8217;s wish to protect him might spring from
sentimental tenderness. But if this were so, she would
hardly have been so frank and have admitted that he
was weak. Moreover, if she found his society congenial,
she would not insist on keeping him away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are afraid some of the others might take advantage
of his rashness?&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you
trust me to see this doesn&#8217;t happen?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It did happen, not long ago. And you can&#8217;t go
very far; one can&#8217;t be rude to one&#8217;s guests.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Kenwardine, smiling, &#8220;it&#8217;s kind of
you to make an excuse for me. On the whole, of
course, I like you to be fastidious in your choice of
friends, but one should temper severity with sense.
I don&#8217;t want you to get as exacting as Brandon, for
example.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid he was right when he tried to keep
Fuller away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right in thinking my house was unsafe for the
lad, and in warning him that you and I were unfit for
him to associate with?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kenwardine studied the girl. She looked distressed,
and he thought this significant, but after a moment or
two she answered steadily:
</p>
<p>&#8220;After all, Brandon had some grounds for thinking
so. I would much sooner you didn&#8217;t urge me to ask
Jake Fuller.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Kenwardine. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you
to do anything that&#8217;s repugnant; but, of course, if
he comes to see me, I can&#8217;t send him off. It isn&#8217;t a
matter of much importance, anyhow.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>He left her, but she was not deceived by his careless
tone. She thought he meant to bring Fuller back
and did not see how she could prevent this, although
she had refused to help. Then she thought about the
plans that Brandon had lost at their house in England.
They had certainly been stolen, for she could
not doubt what he had told her, but it was painful to
admit that her father had taken them. She felt dejected
and lonely, and while she struggled against the
depression Lucille came to say that Jake was waiting
below.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell him I am not at home,&#8221; Clare replied.
</p>
<p>Lucille went away and Clare left the balcony, but
a few minutes later, when she thought Jake had gone,
she went down the stairs and met him coming up. He
stopped with a twinkle of amusement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I sent word that I was not at home,&#8221; she said
haughtily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You did,&#8221; Jake agreed in an apologetic tone. &#8220;It&#8217;s
your privilege, but although I felt rather hurt, I don&#8217;t
see why that should prevent my asking if your father
was in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare&#8217;s indignation vanished. She liked Jake and
was moved by his reproachful look. She determined
to try an appeal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Fuller,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I would sooner you didn&#8217;t
come to see us. It would be better, in several
ways.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He gave her a curious, intent look, in which she
read sympathy. &#8220;I can&#8217;t pretend I don&#8217;t understand,
and you&#8217;re very brave. Still, I&#8217;m not sure you&#8217;re
quite just, to me among others. I&#8217;m a bit of a fool,
but I&#8217;m not so rash as some people think. Anyhow,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
if I were, I&#8217;d still be safe enough in your house.
Sorry, but I can&#8217;t promise to stop away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would really be much better,&#8221; Clare insisted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would it make things any easier for you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Clare. &#8220;In a sense, it could make no
difference to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. I intend to call on your father now
and then. Of course, you needn&#8217;t see me unless you
like, though since I am coming, your keeping out of
the way wouldn&#8217;t do much good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare made a gesture of helpless protest. &#8220;Why
won&#8217;t you be warned? Can&#8217;t you understand? Do
you think it is easy for me to try&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Jake. &#8220;I know it&#8217;s very hard. I
think you&#8217;re mistaken about the necessity for interfering;
that&#8217;s all.&#8221; Then he paused and resumed in
a different tone: &#8220;You see, I imagine that you must
feel lonely at times, and that you might need a friend.
I dare say you&#8217;d find me better than none, and I&#8217;d like
to know that I&#8217;ll have an opportunity of being around
if I&#8217;m wanted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He gave her a quiet, respectful glance, and Clare
knew she had never liked him so much. He looked
trustworthy, and it was a relief to note that there
was no hint of anything but sympathy in his eyes and
voice. He asked nothing but permission to protect
her if there was need. Moreover, since they had been
forced to tread on dangerous ground, he had handled
the situation with courage. She might require a
friend, and his honest sympathy was refreshing by
contrast with the attitude of her father&#8217;s companions.
Some were hard and cynical and some were dissipated,
but all were stamped by a repugnant greediness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
They sought something: money, the gratification of
base desires, success in dark intrigue. Jake with his
chivalrous generosity stood far apart from them; but
he must be saved from becoming like them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I knew how I could keep you away, I would
do so, but I can, at least, see you as seldom as possible,&#8221;
she said and left him.
</p>
<p>Jake knitted his brows as he went on to Kenwardine&#8217;s
room. He understood Clare&#8217;s motive, and admitted
that she meant well, but he was not going to
stop away because she thought this better for him.
There was, however, another matter that demanded
his attention and he felt awkward when Kenwardine
opened the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s some time since you have been to see us,&#8221; the
latter remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; said Jake. &#8220;Perhaps you can understand
that I felt rather shy about coming after the way my
partner arranged the matter of the check.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He arranged it to your advantage, and you ought
to be satisfied. Mr. Brandon is obviously a business
man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack resented the polished sneer. &#8220;He&#8217;s a very good
sort and I&#8217;m grateful to him; but it doesn&#8217;t follow that
I adopt his point of view.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean his views about the payment of one&#8217;s
debts?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jake. &#8220;I don&#8217;t consider the debt
wiped out; in fact, that&#8217;s why I came. I want to make
good, but it will take time. If you will ask your
friends to wait&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kenwardine looked at him with an ironical smile.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this a change of attitude? I understood you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
claimed that you were under a disadvantage through
being drunk and suspected that the game was not
quite straight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was drunk and still suspect Black of crooked
play.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather a grave statement.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I quite see that,&#8221; said Jake. &#8220;However, I deserved
to lose for being drunk when I was betting
high, and don&#8217;t hold you accountable for Black.
You&#8217;d take steep chances if you guaranteed all guests.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kenwardine laughed. &#8220;You&#8217;re remarkably frank;
but there&#8217;s some truth in what you say, although the
convention is that I do guarantee them and their honor&#8217;s
mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll keep to business,&#8221; Jake replied. &#8220;Will you
tell your friends I&#8217;ll pay them out in full as soon as I
can?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. Since they thought the matter closed,
it will be a pleasant surprise, but we&#8217;ll let that go.
Mr. Brandon obviously didn&#8217;t consult your wishes,
but have you any idea what his object was in taking his
very unusual line?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jake; &#8220;if you press me, I have.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He thought he would make it awkward for you
to come here, in fact?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Something like that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you mean to run the risk?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming, if you&#8217;ll allow it,&#8221; Jake answered with
a twinkle. &#8220;The risk isn&#8217;t very great, because if I lose
any more money in the next few months, the winners
will not get paid. The old man certainly won&#8217;t stand
for it if I get into debt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kenwardine pushed a box of cigarettes across. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
congratulate you on your way of making things clear,
and now we understand each other you can come when
you like. Have a smoke.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake took a cigarette, but left soon afterwards to
do an errand of Bethune&#8217;s that had given him an excuse
for visiting the town. Then he went back to
the dam, and after dinner sat outside Dick&#8217;s shack,
pondering what Clare had said. She had, of course,
had some ground for warning him, but he did not
believe yet that Kenwardine meant to exploit his recklessness.
It would not be worth while, for one thing,
since he had never had much money to lose and now
had none. Besides, Kenwardine was not the man to
take a mean advantage of his guest, though Jake could
not say as much for some of his friends. Anyhow,
he meant to go to the house because he felt that Clare
might need his help. He did not see how that might
be, but he had a half-formed suspicion that she might
have to suffer on her father&#8217;s account, and if anything
of the kind happened, he meant to be about.
</p>
<p>Yet he was not in love with her. She attracted
him strongly, and he admitted that it would be remarkably
easy to become infatuated, but did not mean
to let this happen. Though often rash, he had more
sense and self-control than his friends believed, and
realized that Clare was not for him. He could not
tell how he had arrived at this conclusion, but there
it was, and he knew he was not mistaken. Sometimes
he wondered with a twinge of jealousy what
she thought of Brandon.
</p>
<p>By and by he roused himself from his reflections
and looked about. There was no moon and a thin
mist that had stolen out of the jungle drifted past
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
the shack. A coffee-pot and two cups stood upon a
table near his chair, and one cup was half empty, as
Dick had left it when he was unexpectedly summoned
to the dam, where work was going on. The veranda
lamp had been put out, because Jake did not want
to read and a bright light would have attracted moths
and beetles, but Dick had left a lamp burning in his
room, and a faint illumination came through the curtain
on the open window. Everything was very quiet
except when the ringing of hammers and the rattle of
a crane rose from the dam.
</p>
<p>Looking farther round, Jake thought he distinguished
the blurred outline of a human figure in the
mist, but was not surprised. Some ironwork that
made a comfortable seat lay near the shack and the
figure had been there before. For all that, he imagined
the man was wasting his time and keeping an
unnecessary watch. Then his thoughts again centered
on Clare and Kenwardine and some time had
passed when he looked up. Something had disturbed
him, but he could not tell what it was, and on glancing
at the spot where he had seen the figure he found it
had gone.
</p>
<p>Next moment a board in the house creaked softly,
as if it had been trodden on; but the boards often
did so after a change of temperature, and Jake sat
still. Their colored servant had asked leave to go
down to the camp and was perhaps now coming back.
One had to be careful not to give one&#8217;s imagination
too much rein in these hot countries. Payne seemed
to have done so and had got an attack of nerves,
which was curious, because indulgence in native caña
generally led to that kind of thing, and Payne was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
sober. Moreover, he was of the type that is commonly
called hard.
</p>
<p>Jake took out a cigarette and was lighting it when he
heard a swift, stealthy step close behind him. He
dropped the match as he swung round, pushing back
his canvas chair, and found his eyes dazzled by the
sudden darkness. Still he thought he saw a shadow
flit across the veranda and vanish into the mist. Next
moment there were heavier footsteps, and a crash as
a man fell over the projecting legs of the chair. The
fellow rolled down the shallow stairs, dropping a pistol
and then hurriedly got up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop right there, Pepe!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;What
were you doing in that room?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nobody answered and Jake turned to the man, who
was rubbing his leg.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble, Payne?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s lit out, but I reckon I&#8217;d have got him if you&#8217;d
been more careful how you pushed your chair around.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whom did you expect to get?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Payne, &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t Pepe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why did you call him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted the fellow I was after to think I&#8217;d made
a mistake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake could understand this, though the rest was
dark. Pepe was an Indian boy who brought water
and domestic stores to the shack, but would have no
excuse for entering it at night.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I allow he meant to dope the coffee,&#8221; Payne resumed.
</p>
<p>This was alarming, and Jake abruptly glanced at
the table. The intruder must have been close to it
and behind him when he heard the step, and might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
have accomplished his purpose and stolen away had he
not struck the match.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He hadn&#8217;t time,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;We had better
see what he was doing in the house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Payne put away his pistol and they entered Dick&#8217;s
room. Nothing seemed to have been touched, until
Jake placed the lamp on a writing-table where Dick
sometimes worked at night. The drawers beneath it
were locked, but Payne indicated a greasy finger-print
on the writing-pad.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s a dago&#8217;s mark. Mr. Brandon would
wash his hands before he began to write.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake agreed, and picking up the pad thought the
top sheet had been hurriedly removed, because a torn
fragment projected from the leather clip. The sheet
left was covered with faint impressions, but it rather
looked as if these had been made by the ink running
through than by direct contact. Jake wrote a few
words on a scrap of paper and pressing it on the pad
noted the difference.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is strange,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t get the drift
of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Payne looked at him with a dry smile. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll
come out and let me talk, I&#8217;ll try to put you wise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake nodded and they went back to the veranda.
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>DON SEBASTIAN</h3>
</div>

<p>When they returned to the veranda Payne sat
down on the steps. Jake picked up his chair
and looked at him thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I want to know why you have
been prowling about the shack at night. You had
better begin at the beginning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. I guess you know I was put off this
camp soon before you came?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard something about it,&#8221; Jake admitted.
</p>
<p>Payne grinned as if he appreciated his tact, and
then resumed: &#8220;In the settlement where I was
raised, the old fellow who kept the store had a cheat-ledger.
When somebody traded stale eggs and garden-truck
for good groceries, and the storekeeper saw
he couldn&#8217;t make trouble about it without losing a
customer, he said nothing but scored it down against
the man. Sometimes he had to wait a long while, but
sooner or later he squared the account. Now that&#8217;s
my plan with Don Ramon Oliva.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Jake. &#8220;What have you against
him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To begin with, he got me fired. It was a thing
I took my chances of and wouldn&#8217;t have blamed him
for; but I reckon now your father&#8217;s cement wasn&#8217;t
all he was after. He wanted a pull on me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t got that quite clear, but I&#8217;m an American
and could do things he couldn&#8217;t, without being suspected.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said Jake, in a thoughtful tone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, for a clever man, he made a very poor defense
when your partner spotted his game; seemed to
say if they reckoned he&#8217;d been stealing, he&#8217;d let it go
at that. Then, when he&#8217;d got me and found I wasn&#8217;t
the man he wanted, he turned me down. Left me to
live with breeds and niggers!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by your not being the man he
wanted?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Payne smiled in a deprecatory way. &#8220;I allow that
I was willing to make a few dollars on the cement, but
working against white men in a dago plot is a different
thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there is a plot?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Payne quietly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know much
about it, but something&#8217;s going on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake lighted a cigarette while he pondered. He
was not surprised that Payne should talk to him with
confidential familiarity, because the situation warranted
it, and the American workman is not, as a rule,
deferential to his employer. The fellow might be
mistaken, but he believed that Oliva had schemed to
get him into his power and work upon his wish
for revenge. Jake could understand Oliva&#8217;s error.
Payne&#8217;s moral code was rudimentary, but he had some
racial pride and would not act like a treacherous renegade.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I begin to see how your account against Oliva
stands,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;But is that the only entry
in your book?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I guess not,&#8221; Payne replied. &#8220;Mr. Brandon&#8217;s
name is there, but the entry is against myself. It was
a straight fight when he had me fired, and he took me
back when he found I was down and out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake nodded. &#8220;You have already warned Brandon
that he might be in some danger in the town.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. Since then, I reckoned that they were
getting after him <i>here</i>, but we were more likely to hold
them up if they didn&#8217;t know we knew. That&#8217;s why
I called out to show I thought it was Pepe who was
in the shack.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Jake. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing more
to be done in the meantime, but you&#8217;d better tell me
if you find out anything else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Payne went away and when Dick came in Jake took
him into his room and indicated the blotter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you torn off the top sheet in the last few
days?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember doing so, but now I come to
look, it has been torn off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you been writing lately?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Orders for small supplies, specifications of material,
and such things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Concrete, in short?&#8221; Jake remarked. &#8220;Well,
it&#8217;s not an interesting subject to outsiders and sometimes
gets very stale to those who have to handle it.
Are you quite sure you haven&#8217;t been writing about
anything else?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure. Why do you ask?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because, as you see, somebody thought it worth
while to steal the top sheet of your blotter,&#8221; Jake replied.
&#8220;Now perhaps I&#8217;d better tell you something
I&#8217;ve just learned.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>He related what Payne had told him and concluded:
&#8220;I&#8217;m puzzled about Oliva&#8217;s motive. After
all, it could hardly be revenge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Dick, with a thoughtful frown, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t imagine it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what does he expect to gain?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick was silent for a few moments with knitted
brows, and then asked: &#8220;You have a Monroe Doctrine,
haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We certainly have,&#8221; Jake agreed, smiling. &#8220;We
reaffirmed it not long ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Roughly speaking, the Doctrine states that no
European power can be allowed to set up a naval base
or make warlike preparations in any part of America.
In fact, you warn all foreigners to keep their hands
off?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s its general purport; but while I support it
patriotically, I can&#8217;t tell you exactly what it says.
Anyhow, I don&#8217;t see what this has to do with the
matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor do I, but it seems to promise a clue,&#8221; Dick
answered dryly. He frowned at the blotter and then
added: &#8220;We&#8217;ll leave it at that. I&#8217;ve some vague
suspicions, but nothing to act upon. If the thing gets
any plainer, I&#8217;ll let you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what about Payne? Is he to hang around
here nights with his gun?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t necessary. But there&#8217;d
be no harm in our taking a few precautions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stretched his arms wearily when Jake left him,
for he had had a tiring day and had now been given
ground for anxious thought. He had not troubled
much about Oliva while he imagined that the fellow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
was actuated by a personal grudge, but his antagonism
began to look more dangerous. Suppose the Adexe
coaling station was intended to be something of the
nature of a naval base? Munitions and other contraband
of war might be quietly sent off with fuel to
fighting ships. Richter, the German, had certainly
been associated with Kenwardine, who had made an
opportunity for telling Jake that they had disagreed.
Then suppose the owners of the station had learned
that they were being spied upon? Dick admitted that
he might not have been as tactful as he thought; and
he was employed by an influential American. The
Americans might be disposed to insist upon a strict
observance of the Monroe Doctrine. Granting all
this, if he was to be dealt with, it would be safer to
make use of a half-breed who was known to have
some ground for hating him.
</p>
<p>Dick, however, reflected that he was taking much
for granted and his suppositions might well be wrong.
It was unwise to attach too much importance to a
plausible theory. Then he could not expose Kenwardine
without involving Clare, and saw no means
of separating them. Besides, Kenwardine&#8217;s position
was strong. The officials were given to graft, and he
had, no doubt, made a skilful use of bribes. Warnings
about him would not be listened to, particularly
as he was carrying on a thriving business and paying
large sums in wages in a country that depended on
foreign capital.
</p>
<p>Then Dick got up with a frown. His head ached
and he was tired after working since sunrise in enervating
heat. The puzzle could not be solved now,
and he must wait until he found out something more.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>For the next two or three evenings he was kept
busy at the dam, where work was carried on after
dark, and Jake, taking advantage of this, went to
Santa Brigida one night when he knew the locomotive
would be coming back up the line. Nothing of importance
happened at Kenwardine&#8217;s, where he did not
see Clare, and on his return he took a short cut through
a badly-lighted part of the town. There was perhaps
some risk in this, but Jake seldom avoided an adventure.
Nothing unusual happened as he made his way
through the narrow streets, until he reached a corner
where a noisy group hung about the end house. As
the men did not look sober, he took the other side
of the street, where the light of a lamp fell upon
him.
</p>
<p>His close-fitting white clothes distinguished him
from the picturesque untidiness of the rest, and when
somebody shouted, &#8220;<i>Un Gringo!</i>&#8221; one or two moved
across as if to stop him. Jake walked on quickly,
looking straight in front without seeming to notice
the others, in the hope of getting past before they got
in his way, but a man dressed like a respectable citizen
came round the corner and the peons ran off. Since
the appearance of a single stranger did not seem to
account for this, Jake wondered what had alarmed
them, until he saw a rural guard in white uniform behind
the other. When the man came up the <i>rurale</i>
stopped and raised his hand as if he meant to salute,
but let it fall again, and Jake imagined that the first
had given him a warning glance. He knew the thin,
dark-faced Spaniard, whom he had met at Kenwardine&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>The man touched Jake&#8217;s shoulder and drew him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
away, and the lad thought it strange that the <i>rurale</i>
went on without asking a question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that the peons meant to make
trouble, but I&#8217;m glad you came along, Don Sebastian,&#8221;
he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an honor to have been of some service, but
it looks as if you were as rash in other matters as you
are at cards,&#8221; the Spaniard answered. &#8220;These dark
<i>calles</i> are unsafe for foreigners.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So it seems, but I&#8217;m afraid it will be a long time
before I&#8217;m worth robbing,&#8221; Jake replied, and then remembered
with embarrassment that the other was one
of the party whose winnings he had not yet paid.
</p>
<p>Don Sebastian smiled, but said suavely: &#8220;For all
that, you should not take an unnecessary risk. You
have been attacked once already, I think?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but it was my partner who got hurt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is one of the ironies of luck. Señor Brandon
is sober and cautious, but he gets injured when he
comes to protect you, who are rash.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s what you say, but I didn&#8217;t know you had
met him,&#8221; Jake replied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard of him; you foreigners are talked
about in the cafés. They talk much in Santa Brigida;
many have nothing else to do. But have you and
Señor Brandon only been molested once?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake hesitated for a moment. He liked the man
and on the whole thought he could be trusted, while
he imagined that he was not prompted by idle curiosity
but knew something. Besides, Jake was often impulsive
and ready, as he said, to back his judgment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We were only once actually attacked, but something
rather curious happened not long ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Don Sebastian, &#8220;this is interesting,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
and as I know something of the intrigues that go on
in the city it might be to your advantage to tell me
about it. There is a quiet wine-shop not far off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would it be safe to go in?&#8221; Jake asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; his companion answered, smiling.
</p>
<p>Jake presently followed him into a small, dimly
lighted room, and noted that the landlord came to wait
on them with obsequious attention. Two peons were
drinking in a corner, but they went out when the landlord
made a sign. Jake thought this curious, but Don
Sebastian filled his glass and gave him a cigarette.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we have the place to ourselves
and you can tell your story.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake related how a stranger had stolen into their
shack a few days ago, and Don Sebastian listened attentively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not think it was one of the peons employed
at the dam?&#8221; he suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jake. &#8220;Anyhow, Payne seemed satisfied
it wasn&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He would probably know them better than you.
Do you keep money in the house?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very little. We lock up the money for wages in
the pay-office safe. Anyhow, I&#8217;m not sure the fellow
came to steal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he did so, one would not imagine that he would
be satisfied with blotting-paper,&#8221; Don Sebastian agreed.
&#8220;You said there was some coffee on the table.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was. Payne reckoned the fellow meant to
dope it. What do you think?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is possible, if he had ground for being revengeful.
Some of the Indians from the mountains are
expert poisoners. But why should anybody wish to
injure your comrade?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t suggest that he wished to injure Brandon.
He might have meant to dope me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Don Sebastian smiled. &#8220;That is so, but on the
whole I do not think it probable. Do you know of
anybody whom your friend has harmed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake decided to tell him about Oliva. He was now
convinced that Don Sebastian knew more than he admitted
and that his interest was not unfriendly. Besides,
there was somehow a hint of authority in the
fellow&#8217;s thin, dark face. He showed polite attention
as Jake narrated the events that had led to Oliva&#8217;s dismissal,
but the lad imagined that he was telling him
nothing he had not already heard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The motive may have been revenge, but as Señor
Brandon was stabbed that ought to satisfy his enemy.
Besides, these people are unstable; they do not even
indulge in hatred long. Do you know if your comrade
has taken any part in political intrigue?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s most unlikely; he would make a very poor
conspirator,&#8221; Jake replied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then have you heard of any señorita, or perhaps
a half-breed girl who has taken his fancy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jake. &#8220;Dick is not that kind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He thought Don Sebastian had been clearing the
ground, eliminating possibilities to which he did not
attach much weight, and waited with interest for his
remarks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the Spaniard, &#8220;I think you and the
man, Payne, should watch over your friend, but it
might be better if you did not tell him you are doing
so or ask him any questions, and I would sooner you
did not mention this interview. If, however, anything
suspicious happens again, it might be an advantage if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
you let me know. You can send word to me at the
hotel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at Kenwardine&#8217;s?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Don Sebastian gave him a quiet glance, but Jake
thought it was keenly observant and remembered how,
one night when a messenger entered Kenwardine&#8217;s
patio, Richter, the German, had stood where he obstructed
the Spaniard&#8217;s view.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I should prefer the hotel. Will
you promise?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; Jake answered impulsively. &#8220;However,
you seem to suggest that I should leave my partner to
grapple with this thing himself and I don&#8217;t like that.
If he&#8217;s up against any danger, I want to butt in.
Dick&#8217;s no fool, but there are respects in which he&#8217;s not
very keen. His mind&#8217;s fixed on concrete, and when
he gets off it his imagination&#8217;s sometimes rather
weak&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stopped, feeling that he must not seem to censure
his friend, and Don Sebastian nodded with a
twinkle of amusement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I understand. There are, however, men
of simple character and no cunning who are capable
of going far and sometimes surprise the friends who
do not know them very well. I cannot tell if Señor
Brandon is one of these, but it is not impossible.
After all, it is often the clever man who makes the
worst mistakes; and on the whole I imagine it would
be wiser to leave your comrade alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He got up and laid his hand on Jake&#8217;s arm with a
friendly gesture. &#8220;Now I will put you on your way,
and if you feel puzzled or alarmed in future, you can
come to me.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>DICK MAKES A BOLD VENTURE</h3>
</div>

<p>Some delicate and important work was being
done, and Stuyvesant had had his lunch sent up
to the dam. Bethune and Dick joined him afterwards,
and sat in the shade of a big traveling crane. Stuyvesant
and Dick were hot and dirty, for it was not
their custom to be content with giving orders when
urgent work was going on. Bethune looked languid
and immaculately neat. His speciality was mathematics,
and he said he did not see why the man with
mental talents should dissipate his energy by using his
hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s curious about that French liner,&#8221; Stuyvesant
presently remarked. &#8220;I understand her passengers
have been waiting since yesterday and she hasn&#8217;t arrived.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The last boat cut out Santa Brigida without notice,&#8221;
Bethune replied. &#8220;My opinion of the French
is that they&#8217;re a pretty casual lot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the surface. They smile and shrug where we
set our teeth, but when you get down to bed-rock
you don&#8217;t find much difference. I thought as you
do, until I went over there and saw a people that run
us close for steady, intensive industry. Their small
cultivators are simply great. I&#8217;d like to put them on
our poorer land in the Middle West, where we&#8217;re content
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
with sixteen bushels of wheat that&#8217;s most fit for
chicken feed to the acre. Then what they don&#8217;t know
about civil engineering isn&#8217;t worth learning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bethune made a gesture of agreement. &#8220;They&#8217;re
certainly fine engineers and they&#8217;re putting up a pretty
good fight just now, but these Latins puzzle me. Take
the Iberian branch of the race, for example. We have
Spanish peons here who&#8217;ll stand for as much work
and hardship as any Anglo-Saxon I&#8217;ve met. Then an
educated Spaniard&#8217;s hard to beat for intellectual
subtlety. Chess is a game that&#8217;s suited to my turn
of mind, but I&#8217;ve been badly whipped in Santa Brigida.
They&#8217;ve brains and application, and yet they don&#8217;t
progress. What&#8217;s the matter with them, anyway?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect they can&#8217;t formulate a continuous policy
and stick to it, and they keep brains and labor too far
apart; the two should coordinate. But I wonder
what&#8217;s holding up the mail boat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do they know when she left the last port?&#8221; Dick,
who had listened impatiently, asked with concealed interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They do. It&#8217;s a short run and she ought to have
arrived yesterday morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Germans can&#8217;t have got her. They have no
commerce-destroyers in these waters,&#8221; Bethune remarked,
with a glance at Dick. &#8220;Your navy corralled
the lot, I think.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick wondered why Bethune looked at him, but he
answered carelessly: &#8220;So one understands. But it&#8217;s
strange the French company cut out the last call.
There was a big quantity of freight on the mole.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks as if the agent had suspected something,&#8221;
Stuyvesant replied. &#8220;However, that&#8217;s not our affair,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
and you want to get busy and have your specifications
and cost-sheets straight when Fuller comes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Fuller is coming back!&#8221; Dick exclaimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be here to-morrow night. I imagined
Bethune had told you about the cablegram he sent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t; I expect he thought his getting a
scratch lunch more important,&#8221; Dick replied, looking
at his watch. &#8220;Well, I must see everything&#8217;s ready
before the boys make a start.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went away with swift, decided steps through the
scorching heat, and Stuyvesant smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There you have a specimen of the useful Anglo-Saxon
type. I don&#8217;t claim that he&#8217;s a smart man all
round, but he can concentrate on his work and put
over what he takes in hand. You wouldn&#8217;t go to him
for a brilliant plan, but give him an awkward job
and he&#8217;ll make good. I expect he&#8217;ll get a lift up when
Fuller has taken a look round.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He deserves it,&#8221; Bethune agreed.
</p>
<p>Though the heat was intense and the glare from the
white dam dazzling, Dick found work something of
a relief. It was his habit to fix his mind upon the
task in which he was engaged; but of late his thoughts
had been occupied by Clare and conjectures about the
Adexe coaling station and the strange black-funnel
boat. The delay in the French liner&#8217;s arrival had
made the matter look more urgent, but he had now an
excuse for putting off its consideration. His duty
to his employer came first. There were detailed plans
that must be worked out before Fuller came and things
he would want to know, and Dick sat up late at night
in order to have the answers ready.
</p>
<p>Fuller arrived, and after spending a few days at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
works came to Dick&#8217;s shack one evening. For an
hour he examined drawings and calculations, asking
Jake a sharp question now and then, and afterwards
sent him away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can put up the papers now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
go out on the veranda. It&#8217;s cooler there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He dropped into a canvas chair, for the air was
stagnant and enervating, and looked down at the clustering
lights beside the sea for a time. Then he said
abruptly: &#8220;Jake seems to know his business. You
have taught him well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He learned most himself,&#8221; Dick answered modestly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Fuller with some dryness, &#8220;that&#8217;s the
best plan, but you put him on the right track and kept
him there; I guess I know my son. Has he made
trouble for you in other ways?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;None worth mentioning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Fuller gave him a keen glance and then indicated
the lights of the town.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the danger-spot. Does he go down there
often?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I make it as difficult as possible, but can&#8217;t
stop him altogether.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Fuller nodded. &#8220;I guess you used some tact, because
he likes you and you&#8217;d certainly have had trouble
if you&#8217;d snubbed him up too hard. Anyway, I&#8217;m
glad to acknowledge that you have put me in your
debt. You can see how I was fixed. Bethune&#8217;s not
the man to guide a headstrong lad, and Stuyvesant&#8217;s
his boss. If he&#8217;d used any official pressure, Jake
would have kicked. That&#8217;s why I wanted a steady
partner for him who had no actual authority.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>&#8220;In a sense, you ran some risk in choosing me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I chose you, to begin with,&#8221;
Fuller answered with a twinkle. &#8220;I imagine my
daughter made me think as I did, but I&#8217;m willing to
state that her judgment was good. We&#8217;ll let that go.
You have seen Jake at his work; do you think he&#8217;ll
make an engineer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Dick, and then recognizing friendship&#8217;s
claim, added bluntly: &#8220;But he&#8217;ll make a better artist.
He has the gift.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Fuller, in a thoughtful tone, &#8220;we&#8217;ll
talk of it again. In the meantime, he&#8217;s learning how
big jobs are done and dollars are earned, and that&#8217;s a
liberal education. However, I&#8217;ve a proposition here
I&#8217;d like your opinion of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick&#8217;s heart beat as he read the document his employer
handed him. It was a formal agreement by
which he engaged his services to Fuller until the irrigation
work was completed, in return for a salary that
he thought remarkably good.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s much more than I had any reason to expect,&#8221;
he said with some awkwardness. &#8220;In fact, although
I don&#8217;t know that I have been of much help to Jake,
I&#8217;d sooner you didn&#8217;t take this way of repaying me.
One would prefer not to mix friendship with business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yours is not a very common view,&#8221; Fuller replied,
smiling. &#8220;However, I&#8217;m merely offering to buy
your professional skill, and want to know if you&#8217;re
satisfied with my terms.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re generous,&#8221; said Dick with emotion, for
he saw what the change in his position might enable
him to do. &#8220;There&#8217;s only one thing: the agreement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
is to stand until the completion of the dam. What
will happen afterwards?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then if I have no more use for you here, I think
I can promise to find you as good or better job. Is
that enough?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick gave him a grateful look. &#8220;It&#8217;s difficult to
tell you how I feel about it, but I&#8217;ll do my best to make
good and show that you have not been mistaken.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Fuller, getting up. &#8220;Sign
the document when you can get a witness and let me
have it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went away and Dick sat down and studied the
agreement with a beating heart. He found his work
engrossing, he liked the men he was associated with,
and saw his way to making his mark in his profession,
but there was another cause for the triumphant thrill
he felt. Clare must be separated from Kenwardine
before she was entangled in his dangerous plots, and
he had brooded over his inability to come to her rescue.
Now, however, one obstacle was removed. He
could offer her some degree of comfort if she could
be persuaded to marry him. It was obvious that she
must be taken out of her father&#8217;s hands as soon as
possible, and he determined to try to gain her consent
next morning, though he was very doubtful of his
success.
</p>
<p>When he reached the house, Clare was sitting at
a table in the patio with some work in her hand.
Close by, the purple creeper spread across the wall,
and the girl&#8217;s blue eyes and thin lilac dress harmonized
with its deeper color. Her face and half-covered arms
showed pure white against the background, but the
delicate pink that had once relieved the former was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
now less distinct. The hot, humid climate had begun
to set its mark on her, and Dick thought she looked
anxious and perplexed.
</p>
<p>She glanced up when she heard his step, and moving
quietly forward he stopped on the opposite side of the
table with his hand on a chair. He knew there was
much against him and feared a rebuff, but delay might
be dangerous and he could not wait. Standing quietly
resolute, he fixed his eyes on the girl&#8217;s face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your father at home, Miss Kenwardine?&#8221; he
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Clare. &#8220;He went out some time ago,
and I cannot tell when he will come back. Do you
want to see him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know yet. It depends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He thought she was surprised and curious, but she
said nothing, and nerving himself for the plunge, he
resumed: &#8220;I came to see you in the first place. I&#8217;m
afraid you&#8217;ll be astonished, Clare, but I want to know
if you will marry me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She moved abruptly, turned her head for a moment,
and then looked up at him while the color gathered in
her face. Her expression puzzled Dick, but he imagined
that she was angry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am astonished. Isn&#8217;t it a rather extraordinary
request, after what you said on board the launch?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;it&#8217;s very natural from my point
of view. You see, I fell in love with you the first
time we met; but I got into disgrace soon afterwards
and have had a bad time since. This made it impossible
for me to tell you what I felt; but things are
beginning to improve&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stopped, seeing no encouragement in her expression,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
for Clare was fighting a hard battle. His blunt
simplicity made a strong appeal. She had liked and
trusted him when he had with callow but honest chivalry
offered her his protection one night in England
and he had developed fast since then. Hardship had
strengthened and in a sense refined him. He looked
resolute and soldierlike as he waited. Still, for his
sake as well as hers, she must refuse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you must be easily moved,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You
knew nothing about me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d seen you; that was quite enough,&#8221; Dick declared
and stopped. Her look was gentler and he
might do better if he could lessen the distance between
them and take her hand; he feared he had been painfully
matter-of-fact. Perhaps he was right, but the
table stood in the way, and if he moved round it, she
would take alarm. It was exasperating to be baulked
by a piece of furniture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides,&#8221; he resumed, &#8220;when everybody doubted
me, you showed your confidence. You wrote and
said&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you told me you tore up the letter,&#8221; Clare
interrupted.
</p>
<p>Dick got confused. &#8220;I did; I was a fool, but the
way things had been going was too much for me.
You ought to understand and try to make allowances.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot understand why you want to marry a girl
you think a thief.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Pulling himself together, Dick gave her a steady
look. &#8220;I can&#8217;t let that pass, though if I begin to
argue I&#8217;m lost. In a way, I&#8217;m at your mercy, because
my defense can only make matters worse. But I tried
to explain on board the launch.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The explanation wasn&#8217;t very convincing,&#8221; Clare
remarked, turning her head. &#8220;Do you still believe I
took your papers?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The plans were in my pocket when I reached your
house,&#8221; said Dick, who saw he must be frank. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know that you took them, and if you did, I
wouldn&#8217;t hold you responsible; but they were taken.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean that you blame my father for their
loss?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick hesitated. He felt that she was giving him a
last opportunity, but he could not seize it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I pretended I didn&#8217;t blame him, you would find
me out and it would stand between us. I wish I could
say I&#8217;d dropped the papers somewhere or find some
other way; but the truth is best.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare turned to him with a hot flush and an angry
sparkle in her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s unthinkable that you should marry the
daughter of the man whom you believe ruined you.
Don&#8217;t you see that you can&#8217;t separate me from my
father? We must stand together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Dick doggedly, knowing that he was
beaten, &#8220;I don&#8217;t see that. I want you; I want to take
you away from surroundings and associations that
must jar. Perhaps it was foolish to think you would
come, but you helped to save my life when I was ill,
and I believe I was then something more to you than a
patient. Why have you changed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked at him with a forced and rather bitter
smile. &#8220;Need you ask? Can&#8217;t you, or won&#8217;t you,
understand? Could I marry my victim, which is what
you are if your suspicions are justified? If they are
not, you have offered me an insult I cannot forgive.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
It is unbearable to be thought the daughter of a thief.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick nerved himself for a last effort. &#8220;What does
your father&#8217;s character matter? I want you. You
will be safe from everything that could hurt you if
you come to me.&#8221; He hesitated and then went on in a
hoarse, determined voice: &#8220;You must come. I can&#8217;t
let you live among those plotters and gamblers. It&#8217;s
impossible. Clare, when I was ill and you thought me
asleep, I watched you sitting in the moonlight. Your
face was wonderfully gentle and I thought&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>She rose and stopped him with a gesture. &#8220;There
is no more to be said, Mr. Brandon. I cannot marry
you, and if you are generous, you will go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick, who had been gripping the chair hard, let his
hand fall slackly and turned away. Clare watched
him cross the patio, and stood tensely still, fighting
against an impulse to call him back as he neared the
door. Then as he vanished into the shadow of the
arch she sat down with sudden limpness and buried
her hot face in her hands.

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>THE OFFICIAL MIND</h3>
</div>

<p>On the evening after Clare&#8217;s refusal, Dick entered
the principal café at Santa Brigida. The large,
open-fronted room was crowded, for, owing to the
duty, newspapers were not generally bought by the
citizens, who preferred to read them at the cafés, and
the <i>Diario</i> had just come in. The eagerness to secure
a copy indicated that something important had happened,
and after listening to the readers&#8217; remarks, Dick
gathered that the French liner had sunk and a number
of her passengers were drowned. This, however, did
not seem to account for the angry excitement some of
the men showed, and Dick waited until a polite half-breed
handed him the newspaper.
</p>
<p>A ship&#8217;s lifeboat, filled with exhausted passengers,
had reached a bay some distance along the coast, and
it appeared from their stories that the liner was steaming
across a smooth sea in the dark when a large vessel,
which carried no lights, emerged from a belt of haze
and came towards her. The French captain steered
for the land, hoping to reach territorial waters, where
he would be safe, but the stranger was faster and
opened fire with a heavy gun. The liner held on,
although she was twice hit, but after a time there was
an explosion below and her colored firemen ran up on
deck. Then the ship stopped, boats were hoisted out,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
and it was believed that several got safely away,
though only one had so far reached the coast. This
boat was forced to pass the attacking vessel rather
close, and an officer declared that she looked like one
of the Spanish liners and her funnel was black.
</p>
<p>Dick gave the newspaper to the next man and sat
still with knitted brows, for his suspicions were suddenly
confirmed. The raider had a black funnel, and
was no doubt the ship he had seen steering for Adexe.
An enemy commerce-destroyer was lurking about the
coast, and she could not be allowed to continue her
deadly work, which her resemblance to the Spanish
vessels would make easier. For all that, Dick saw
that anything he might do would cost him much, since
Clare had said that she and Kenwardine must stand
together. This was true, in a sense, because if Kenwardine
got into trouble, she would share his disgrace
and perhaps his punishment. Moreover, she might
think he had been unjustly treated and blame Dick for
helping to persecute him. Things were getting badly
entangled, and Dick, leaning back in his chair, vacantly
looked about.
</p>
<p>The men had gathered in groups round the tables,
their dark faces showing keen excitement as they
argued with dramatic gestures about international law.
For the most part, they looked indignant, but Dick
understood that they did not expect much from their
Government. One said the English would send a
cruiser and something might be done by the Americans;
another explained the Monroe Doctrine in a
high-pitched voice. Dick, however, tried not to listen,
because difficulties he had for some time seen approaching
must now be faced.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p>He had been forced to leave England in disgrace,
and his offense would be remembered if he returned.
Indeed, he had come to regard America as his home,
but patriotic feelings he had thought dead had awakened
and would not be denied. He might still be able
to serve his country and meant to do so, though it
was plain that this would demand a sacrifice. Love
and duty clashed, but he must do his best and leave
the rest to luck. Getting up with sudden resolution,
he left the café and went to the British consulate.
</p>
<p>When he stopped outside the building, to which the
royal arms were fixed, he remarked that two peons
were lounging near, but, without troubling about them,
knocked at the door. There was only a Vice-Consul
at Santa Brigida, and the post, as sometimes happens,
was held by a merchant, who had, so a clerk stated,
already gone home. Dick, however, knew where he
lived and determined to seek him at his house. He
looked round once or twice on his way there, without
seeing anybody who seemed to be following him, but
when he reached the iron gate he thought a dark figure
stopped in the gloom across the street. Still, it might
only be a citizen going into his house, and Dick rang
the bell.
</p>
<p>He was shown on to a balcony where the Vice-Consul
sat with his Spanish wife and daughter at a
table laid with wine and fruit. He did not look
pleased at being disturbed, but told Dick to sit down
when the ladies withdrew.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you can state your business, but
I have an appointment in a quarter of an hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick related his suspicions about the coaling company,
and described what he had seen at Adexe and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
the visit of the black-funnel boat, but before he had
gone far, realized that he was wasting his time. The
Vice-Consul&#8217;s attitude was politely indulgent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a rather extraordinary tale,&#8221; he remarked
when Dick stopped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have told you what I saw and what I think it
implies,&#8221; Dick answered with some heat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so. I do not doubt your honesty, but it is
difficult to follow your arguments.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It oughtn&#8217;t to be difficult. You have heard that
the French liner was sunk by a black-funnel boat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Black funnels are common. Why do you imagine
the vessel you saw was an auxiliary cruiser?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because her crew looked like navy men. They
were unusually numerous and were busy at drill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Boat or fire drill probably. They often exercise
them at it on board passenger ships. Besides, I think
you stated that it was dark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick pondered for a few moments. He had heard
that Government officials were hard to move, and knew
that, in hot countries, Englishmen who marry native
wives sometimes grow apathetic and succumb to the
climatic lethargy. But this was not all: he had to
contend against the official dislike of anything informal
and unusual. Had he been in the navy, his
warning would have received attention, but as he was
a humble civilian he had, so to speak, no business to
know anything about such matters.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you can make inquiries and see
if my conclusions are right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Vice-Consul smiled. &#8220;That is not so. You
can pry into the coaling company&#8217;s affairs and, if you
are caught, it would be looked upon as an individual
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
impertinence. If I did anything of the kind, it would
reflect upon the Foreign Office and compromise our
relations with a friendly state. The Adexe wharf is
registered according to the laws of this country as
being owned by a native company.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then go to the authorities and tell them what you
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The difficulty is that I know nothing except that
you have told me a somewhat improbable tale.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you surely don&#8217;t mean to let the raider do
what she likes? Her next victim may be a British
vessel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I imagine the British admiralty will attend to that,
and I have already sent a cablegram announcing the
loss of the French boat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick saw that he was doubted and feared that argument
would be useless, but he would not give in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A raider must have coal and it&#8217;s not easy to get
upon this coast,&#8221; he resumed. &#8220;You could render
her harmless by cutting off supplies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know much about international law and
how far it prohibits a neutral country from selling
coal to a belligerent?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about it; but if our Foreign
Office is any good, they ought to be able to stop
the thing,&#8221; Dick answered doggedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let me try to show you how matters stand.
We will suppose that your suspicions were correct and
I thought fit to make representations to the Government
of this country. What do you think would happen?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d be forced to investigate your statements.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. The head of a department would be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
asked to report. You probably know that every official
whose business brings him into touch with it
is in the coaling company&#8217;s pay; I imagine there is
not a foreign trader here who does not get small favors
in return for bribes. Bearing this in mind, it
is easy to understand what the report would be. I
should have shown that we suspected the good faith
of a friendly country, and there would be nothing
gained.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, you can&#8217;t let the matter drop,&#8221; Dick insisted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Although you have given me no proof of your
statements, which seem to be founded on conjectures,
I have not said that I intend to let it drop. In the
meantime I am entitled to ask for some information
about yourself. You look like an Englishman and
have not been here long. Did you leave home after
the war broke out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Dick, who saw where he was leading,
&#8220;very shortly afterwards.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why? Men like you are needed for the army.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick colored, but looked his questioner steadily in
the face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was in the army. They turned me out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Vice-Consul made a gesture. &#8220;I have nothing
to do with the reason for this; but you can see my difficulty.
You urge me to meddle with things that require
very delicate handling and with which my interference
would have to be justified. No doubt, you
can imagine the feelings of my superiors when I admitted
that I acted upon hints given me by a stranger
in the employ of Americans, who owned to having
been dismissed from the British army.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick got up, with his face firmly set.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. There&#8217;s no more to be said. I won&#8217;t
trouble you again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leaving the house, he walked moodily back to the
end of the line. The Vice-Consul was a merchant
and thought first of his business, which might suffer
if he gained the ill-will of corrupt officials. He would,
no doubt, move if he were forced, but he would demand
incontestable proof, which Dick feared he could
not find. Well, he had done his best and been rebuffed,
and now the temptation to let the matter drop
was strong. To go on would bring him into conflict
with Kenwardine, and perhaps end in his losing
Clare, but he must go on. For all that, he would
leave the Vice-Consul alone and trust to getting some
help from his employer&#8217;s countrymen. If it could
be shown that the enemy was establishing a secret
base for naval operations at Adexe, he thought the
Americans would protest. The Vice-Consul, however,
had been of some service by teaching him the
weakness of his position. He must strengthen it by
carefully watching what went on, and not interfere
until he could do so with effect. Finding the locomotive
waiting, he returned to his shack and with an
effort fixed his mind upon the plans of some work that
he must superintend in the morning.
</p>
<p>For the next few days he was busily occupied. A
drum of the traveling crane broke and as it could not
be replaced for a time, Dick put up an iron derrick
of Bethune&#8217;s design to lower the concrete blocks into
place. They were forced to use such material as they
could find, and the gang of peons who handled the
chain-tackle made a poor substitute for a steam engine.
In consequence, the work progressed slowly and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
Stuyvesant ordered it to be carried on into the night.
Jake and Bethune grumbled, but Dick found the longer
hours and extra strain something of a relief. He had
now no leisure to indulge in painful thoughts; besides,
while he was busy at the dam he could not
watch Kenwardine, and his duty to his employer justified
his putting off an unpleasant task.
</p>
<p>One hot night he stood, soaked with perspiration
and dressed in soiled duck clothes, some distance beneath
the top of the dam, which broke down to a
lower level at the spot. There was no moon, but a
row of blast-lamps that grew dimmer as they receded
picked out the tall embankment with jets of pulsating
flame. Glimmering silvery gray in the light, it cut
against the gloom in long sweeping lines, with a
molded rib that added a touch of grace where the
slope got steeper towards its top. This was Dick&#8217;s
innovation. He had fought hard for it and when
Jake supported him Stuyvesant had written to Fuller,
who sanctioned the extra cost. The rib marked the
fine contour of the structure and fixed its bold curve
upon the eye.
</p>
<p>Where the upper surface broke off, two gangs of
men stood beside the tackles that trailed away from
the foot of the derrick. The flame that leaped with
a roar from a lamp on a tripod picked out some of
the figures with harsh distinctness, but left the rest
dim and blurred. Dick stood eight or nine feet below,
with the end of the line, along which the blocks
were brought, directly above his head. A piece of
rail had been clamped across the metals to prevent the
truck running over the edge. Jake stood close by
on the downward slope of the dam. Everything was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
ready for the lowering of the next block, but they had
a few minutes to wait.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That rib&#8217;s a great idea,&#8221; Jake remarked. &#8220;Tones
up the whole work; it&#8217;s curious what you can do with
a flowing line, but it must be run just right. Make
it the least too flat and you get harshness, too full and
the effect&#8217;s vulgarly pretty or voluptuous. Beauty&#8217;s
severely chaste and I allow, as far as form goes, this
dam&#8217;s a looker.&#8221; He paused and indicated the indigo
sky, flaring lights, and sweep of pearly stone. &#8220;Then
if you want color, you can revel in silver, orange, and
blue.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick, who nodded, shared Jake&#8217;s admiration. He
had helped to build the dam and, in a sense, had come
to love it. Any defacement or injury to it would hurt
him. Just then a bright, blinking spot emerged from
the dark at the other end of the line and increased in
radiance as it came forward, flickering along the slope
of stone. It was the head-lamp of the locomotive
that pushed the massive concrete block they waited
for. The block cut off the light immediately in front
of and below it, and when the engine, snorting harshly,
approached the edge of the gap somebody shouted
and steam was cut off. The truck stopped just short
of the rail fastened across the line, and Dick looked
up.
</p>
<p>The blast-lamp flung its glare upon the engine and
the rays of the powerful head-light drove horizontally
into the dark, but the space beyond the broken end
of the dam was kept in shadow by the block, and the
glitter above dazzled his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Swing the derrick-boom and tell the engineer to
come on a yard or two,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<p>There was a patter of feet, a rattle of chains, and
somebody called: &#8220;<i>Adelante locomotura!</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>The engine snorted, the wheels ground through the
fragments of concrete scattered about the line, and
the big dark mass rolled slowly forward. It seemed
to Dick to be going farther than it ought, but he had
ascertained that the guard-rail was securely fastened.
As he watched the front of the truck, Jake, who stood
a few feet to one side, leaned out and seized his shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jump!&#8221; he cried, pulling him forward.
</p>
<p>Dick made an awkward leap, and alighting on the
steep front of the dam, fell heavily on his side. As
he clutched the stones to save himself from sliding
down, a black mass plunged from the line above and
there was a deafening crash as it struck the spot he
had left. Then a shower of fragments fell upon him
and he choked amidst a cloud of dust. Hoarse shouts
broke out above, and he heard men running about the
dam as he got up, half dazed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you all right, Jake?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a scratch,&#8221; was the answer; and Dick, scrambling
up the bank, called for a lamp.
</p>
<p>It was brought by a big mulatto, and Dick held up
the light. The last-fitted block of the ribbed course
was split in two, and the one that had fallen was
scattered about in massive broken lumps. Amidst
these lay the guard-rail, and the front wheels of the
truck hung across the gap above. There was other
damage, and Dick frowned as he looked about.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be lucky if we get the broken molding out
in a day, and I expect we&#8217;ll have to replace two of
the lower blocks,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be an awkward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
and expensive job now that the cement has set.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221; Jake asked with a forced grin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s enough,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;However, we&#8217;ll be better
able to judge in the daylight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then he turned to the engineer, who was standing
beside the truck, surrounded by excited peons. &#8220;How
did it happen?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had my hand on the throttle when I got the
order to go ahead, and let her make a stroke or two,
reckoning the guard-rail would snub up the car. I
heard the wheels clip and slammed the link-gear over,
because it looked as if she wasn&#8217;t going to stop. When
she reversed, the couplings held the car and the block
slipped off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure you didn&#8217;t give her too much
steam?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. I&#8217;ve been doing this job quite a while,
and know just how smart a push she wants. It was
the guard-rail slipping that made the trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand why it did slip. The fastening
clamps were firm when I looked at them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; remarked the engineer, &#8220;the guard&#8217;s certainly
in the pit, and I felt her give as soon as the car-wheels
bit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick looked hard at him and thought he spoke the
truth. He was a steady fellow and a good driver.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Put your engine in the house and take down the
feed-pump you were complaining about. We won&#8217;t
want her to-morrow,&#8221; he said, and dismissing the men,
returned to his shack, where he sat down rather limply
on the veranda.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand the thing,&#8221; he said to Jake.
&#8220;The guard-rail&#8217;s heavy and I watched the smith make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
the clamps we fixed it with. One claw went over the
rail, the other under the flange of the metal that formed
the track, and sudden pressure would jamb the guard
down. Then, not long before the accident, I hardened
up the clamp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You hit it on the back?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. I&#8217;d have loosened the thing by hitting
the front.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; Jake agreed, somewhat dryly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
look for the clamps in the morning. But you didn&#8217;t
seem very anxious to get out of the way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect I forgot to thank you for warning me.
Anyhow, you know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; said Jake. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t think about
it; your mind was on your job. Still, I suppose you
see that if you&#8217;d been a moment later you&#8217;d have
been smashed pretty flat?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick gave him a quick glance. There was something
curious about Jake&#8217;s tone, but Dick knew he did
not mean to emphasize the value of his warning. It
was plain that he had had a very narrow escape, but
since one must be prepared for accidents in heavy
engineering work, he did not see why this should jar
his nerves. Yet they were jarred. The danger he
had scarcely heeded had now a disturbing effect. He
could imagine what would have happened had he delayed
his leap. However, he was tired, and perhaps
rather highly strung, and he got up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s late, and we had better go to bed,&#8221; he said.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>THE CLAMP</h3>
</div>

<p>When work began next morning, Jake asked
Dick if he should order the peons to search
for the clamps that had held the guard-rail.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;It would be better if
you looked for the things yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. Perhaps you&#8217;re right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick wondered how much Jake suspected, particularly
as he did not appear to be searching for anything
when he moved up and down among the broken
concrete. Half an hour later, when none of the
peons were immediately about, he came up with his
hand in his pocket and indicated a corner beside a
block where there was a little shade and they were not
likely to be overlooked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got one,&#8221; he remarked.
</p>
<p>When they sat down Jake took out a piece of thick
iron about six inches long, forged into something like
the shape of a U, though the curve was different and
one arm was shorter than the other. Much depended
on the curve, for the thing was made on the model
of an old-fashioned but efficient clamp that carpenters
sometimes use for fastening work to a bench. A
blow or pressure on one part wedged it fast, but a
sharp tap on the other enabled it to be lifted off. This
was convenient, because as the work progressed, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
track along the dam had to be lengthened and the
guard fixed across a fresh pair of rails.
</p>
<p>Taking the object from Jake, Dick examined it
carefully. He thought he recognized the dint where
he had struck the iron, and then, turning it over, noted
another mark. This had been made recently, because
the surface of the iron was bright where the hammer
had fallen, and a blow there would loosen the clamp.
He glanced at Jake, who nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks very suspicious, but that&#8217;s all. You can&#8217;t
tell how long the mark would take to get dull. Besides,
we have moved the guard two or three times in
the last few days.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;Still, I wedged the
thing up shortly before the accident. It has stood
a number of shocks; in fact, it can&#8217;t be loosened by
pressure on the back. When do you <i>think</i> the last
blow was struck?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;After yours,&#8221; Jake answered meaningly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the probability is that somebody wanted the
truck to fall into the hole and smash the block.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jake, who paused and looked hard at
Dick. &#8220;But I&#8217;m not sure that was all he wanted.
You were standing right under the block, and if I
hadn&#8217;t been a little to one side, where the lights didn&#8217;t
dazzle me, the smashing of a lot of concrete wouldn&#8217;t
have been the worst damage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick said nothing, but his face set hard as he
braced himself against the unnerving feeling that had
troubled him on the previous night. The great block
had not fallen by accident; it looked as if somebody
had meant to take his life. The cunning of the attempt
daunted him. The blow had been struck in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
manner that left him a very slight chance of escape;
and his subtle antagonist might strike again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do about it?&#8221; Jake resumed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said Dick.
</p>
<p>Jake looked at him in surprise. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see
what you&#8217;re up against?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty obvious; but if I ask questions, I&#8217;ll find
out nothing and show that I&#8217;m suspicious. If we let
the thing go as an accident, we may catch the fellow
off his guard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My notion is that you know more than you mean
to tell. Now you began by taking care of me, but
it looks as if the matter would end in my taking care
of you. Seems to me you need it and I don&#8217;t like to
see you playing a lone hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick gave him a grateful smile. &#8220;If I see how
you can help, I&#8217;ll let you know. In the meantime,
you&#8217;ll say nothing to imply that I&#8217;m on the watch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jake, grinning, &#8220;if you can bluff
Stuyvesant, you&#8217;ll be smarter than I thought. You&#8217;re
a rather obvious person and he&#8217;s not a fool.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went away, but Dick lighted a cigarette and sat
still in the shade. He was frankly daunted, but did
not mean to stop, for he saw that he was following
the right clue. His reason for visiting the Adexe
wharf had been guessed. He had been watched when
he went to the Vice-Consul, and it was plain that his
enemies thought he knew enough to be dangerous.
The difficulty was that he did not know who they
were. He hated to think that Kenwardine was a
party to the plot, but this, while possible, was by no
means certain. At Santa Brigida, a man&#8217;s life was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
not thought of much account, and it would, no doubt,
have been enough if Kenwardine had intimated that
Dick might cause trouble; but then Kenwardine must
have known what was likely to follow his hint.
</p>
<p>After all, however, this was not very important.
He must be careful, but do nothing to suggest that
he understood the risk he ran. If his antagonists
thought him stupid, so much the better. He saw
the difficulty of playing what Jake called a lone hand
against men skilled in the intricate game; but he could
not ask for help until he was sure of his ground. Besides,
he must find a way of stopping Kenwardine
without involving Clare. In the meantime he had
a duty to Fuller, and throwing away his cigarette, resumed
his work.
</p>
<p>Two or three days later he met Kenwardine in a
café where he was waiting for a man who supplied
some stores to the camp. When Kenwardine saw
Dick he crossed the floor and sat down at his table.
His Spanish dress became him, he looked polished
and well-bred, and it was hard to think him a confederate
of half-breed ruffians who would not hesitate
about murder. But Dick wondered whether Clare had
told him about his proposal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I may congratulate you on your recent
promotion? You certainly deserve it,&#8221; Kenwardine
remarked with an ironical smile. &#8220;I imagine your
conscientiousness and energy are unusual, but perhaps
at times rather inconvenient.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks!&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;How did you hear about
the matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In Santa Brigida, one hears everything that goes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
on. We have nothing much to do but talk about our
neighbors&#8217; affairs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick wondered whether Kenwardine meant to hint
that as his time was largely unoccupied he had only
a small part in managing the coaling business, but he
said: &#8220;We are hardly your neighbors at the camp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose that&#8217;s true. We certainly don&#8217;t see you
often.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This seemed to indicate that Kenwardine did not
know about Dick&#8217;s recent visit. He could have no
reason for hiding his knowledge, and it looked as if
Clare did not tell her father everything.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have succeeded in keeping your young friend
out of our way,&#8221; Kenwardine resumed. &#8220;Still, as he
hasn&#8217;t your love of work and sober character, there&#8217;s
some risk of a reaction if you hold him in too hard.
Jake&#8217;s at an age when it&#8217;s difficult to be satisfied with
cement.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick laughed. &#8220;I really did try to keep him, but
was helped by luck. We have been unusually busy
at the dam and although I don&#8217;t know that his love
for cement is strong he doesn&#8217;t often leave a half-finished
job.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you work upon his feelings in that way, I expect
you&#8217;ll beat me; but after all, I&#8217;m not scheming
to entangle the lad. He&#8217;s a bright and amusing
youngster, but there wouldn&#8217;t be much profit in exploiting
him. However, you have had some accidents
at the dam, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick was immediately on his guard, but he answered
carelessly: &#8220;We broke a crane-drum, which
delayed us.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And didn&#8217;t a truck fall down the embankment and
do some damage?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It did,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;We had a big molded block,
which cost a good deal to make, smashed to pieces,
and some others split. I had something of an escape,
too, because I was standing under the block.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was watching Kenwardine and thought his expression
changed and his easy pose stiffened. His
self-control was good, but Dick imagined he was
keenly interested and surprised.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you ran a risk of being killed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Jake, however, saw the danger and warned
me just before the block fell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was lucky. But you have a curious temperament.
When we began to talk of the accidents,
you remembered the damage to Fuller&#8217;s property before
the risk to your life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;you see I wasn&#8217;t hurt, but the
damage still keeps us back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did the truck run off the line? I should
have thought you&#8217;d have taken precautions against anything
of the kind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick pondered. He believed Kenwardine really
was surprised to hear he had nearly been crushed by
the block; but the fellow was clever and had begun
to talk about the accidents. He must do nothing to
rouse his suspicions, and began a painstaking account
of the matter, explaining that the guard-rail had got
loose, but saying nothing about the clamps being tampered
with. Indeed, the trouble he took about the
explanation was in harmony with his character and
his interest in his work, and presently Kenwardine
looked bored.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I quite understand the thing,&#8221; he said, and got
up as the man Dick was waiting for came towards the
table.
</p>
<p>The merchant did not keep Dick long, and he left
the café feeling satisfied. Kenwardine had probably
had him watched and had had something to do with
the theft of the sheet from his blotting pad, but knew
nothing about the attempt upon his life. After hearing
about it, he understood why the accident happened,
but had no cause to think that Dick knew, and some
of his fellow conspirators were responsible for this
part of the plot. Dick wondered whether he would
try to check them now he did know, because if they
tried again, they would do so with Kenwardine&#8217;s tacit
consent.
</p>
<p>A few days later, he was sitting with Bethune and
Jake one evening when Stuyvesant came in and threw
a card, printed with the flag of a British steamship
company, on the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going, but you might like to do so,&#8221; he
said.
</p>
<p>Dick, who was nearest, picked up the card. It was
an invitation to a dinner given to celebrate the first
call of a large new steamship at Santa Brigida, and
he imagined it had been sent to the leading citizens
and merchants who imported goods by the company&#8217;s
vessels. After glancing at it, he passed it on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; Bethune remarked. &#8220;After the Spartan
simplicity we practise at the camp, it will be a refreshing
change to eat a well-served dinner in a mailboat&#8217;s
saloon, though I&#8217;ve no great admiration for British
cookery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be worse than the dago kind we&#8217;re used
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
to,&#8221; Jake broke in. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with it, anyhow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like the British character, heavy and unchanging,&#8221;
Bethune replied. &#8220;A London hotel menu, with
English beer and whisky, in the tropics! Only people
without imagination would offer it to their guests;
and then they&#8217;ve printed a list of the ports she&#8217;s going
to at the bottom. Would any other folk except
perhaps the Germans, couple an invitation with a
hint that they were ready to trade? If a Spaniard
comes to see you on business, he talks for half an
hour about politics or your health, and apologizes for
mentioning such a thing as commerce when he comes
to the point.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The British plan has advantages,&#8221; said Stuyvesant.
&#8220;You know what you&#8217;re doing when you deal
with them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. We know, for example, when this boat
will arrive at any particular place and when she&#8217;ll sail;
while you can reckon on a French liner&#8217;s being three
or four days late and on the probability of a Spaniard&#8217;s
not turning up at all. But whether you have
revolutions, wars, or tidal waves, the Britisher sails
on schedule.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some risk in that just now,&#8221; Stuyvesant
observed.
</p>
<p>Bethune turned to Jake. &#8220;You had better come.
The card states there&#8217;ll be music, and the agent will
hire Vallejo&#8217;s band, which is pretty good. Guitars,
mandolins, and fiddles on the poop, and señoritas in
gauzy dresses flitting through graceful dances in the
after well! The entertainment ought to appeal to
your artistic taste.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going,&#8221; Jake replied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; said Dick.
</p>
<p>Jake grinned. &#8220;That&#8217;s rather sudden, isn&#8217;t it?
However, you may be needed to look after Bethune.&#8221;
</p>
<p>An evening or two later, they boarded the launch
at the town mole. The sea was smooth and glimmered
with phosphorescence in the shadow of the land,
for the moon had not risen far above the mountains.
Outside the harbor mouth, the liner&#8217;s long, black hull
cut against the dusky blue, the flowing curve of her
sheer picked out by a row of lights. Over this rose
three white tiers of passenger decks, pierced by innumerable
bright points, with larger lights in constellations
outside, while masts and funnels ran up, faintly
indicated, into the gloom above. She scarcely moved
to the lift of the languid swell, but as the undulations
passed there was a pale-green shimmer about her
waterline that magnified the height to her topmost
deck. She looked unsubstantial, rather like a floating
fairy palace than a ship, and as the noisy launch drew
nearer Jake gave his imagination rein.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She was made, just right, by magic; a ship of
dreams,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Look how she glimmers, splashed
with cadmium radiance, on velvety blue; and her formlessness
outside the lights wraps her in mystery. Yet
you get a hint of swiftness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know she has power and speed,&#8221; Bethune interrupted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jake firmly, &#8220;it&#8217;s not a matter of
knowledge; she appeals to your imagination. You
feel that airy fabric must travel like the wind.&#8221; Then
he turned to Dick, who was steering. &#8220;There&#8217;s a
boat ahead with a freight of señoritas in white and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
orange gossamer; they know something about grace
of line in this country. Are you going to rush past
them, like a dull barbarian, in this kicking, snorting
launch?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make for the other side of the ship, if you
like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t go so far,&#8221; Jake answered with a
chuckle. &#8220;But you might muzzle your rackety engine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick, who had seen the boat, gave her room enough,
but let the engine run. He imagined that Jake&#8217;s motive
for slowing down might be misunderstood by the
señoritas&#8217; guardian, since a touch of Moorish influence
still colors the Spaniard&#8217;s care of his women.
As the launch swung to starboard her red light shone
into the boat, and Dick recognized Don Sebastian sitting
next a stout lady in a black dress. There were
three or four girls beside them, and then Dick&#8217;s grasp
on the tiller stiffened, for the ruby beam picked out
Clare&#8217;s face. He thought it wore a tired look, but
she turned her head, as if dazzled, and the light passed
on, and Dick&#8217;s heart beat as the boat dropped back
into the gloom. Since Kenwardine had sent Clare
with Don Sebastian, he could not be going, and Dick
might find an opportunity for speaking to her alone.
He meant to do so, although the interview would not
be free from embarrassment. Then he avoided another
boat, and stopping the engine, steered for the
steamer&#8217;s ladder.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>THE ALTERED SAILING LIST</h3>
</div>

<p>When dinner was over, Dick sat by himself
in a quiet spot on the liner&#8217;s quarter-deck.
There was a tall, iron bulwark beside him, but close
by this was replaced by netted rails, through which
he caught the pale shimmer of the sea. The warm
land-breeze had freshened and ripples splashed against
the vessel&#8217;s side, while every now and then a languid
gurgle rose from about her waterline and the foam
her plates threw off was filled with phosphorescent
flame. A string band was playing on the poop, and
passengers and guests moved through the intricate
figures of a Spanish dance on the broad deck below.
Their poses were graceful and their dress was picturesque,
but Dick watched them listlessly.
</p>
<p>He was not in a mood for dancing, for he had been
working hard at the dam and his thoughts were disturbed.
Clare had refused him, and although he did
not accept her decision as final, he could see no way
of taking her out of her father&#8217;s hands, while he had
made no progress towards unraveling the latter&#8217;s plots.
Kenwardine was not on board, but Dick had only seen
Clare at some distance off across the table in the saloon.
Moreover, he thought she must have taken some
trouble to avoid meeting him.
</p>
<p>Then he remembered the speeches made by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
visitors at dinner, and the steamship officers&#8217; replies.
The former, colored by French and Spanish politeness
and American wit, eulogized the power of the
British navy and the courage of her merchant captains.
There was war, they said, but British commerce
went on without a check; goods shipped beneath
the red ensign would be delivered safe in spite of
storm and strife; Britannia, with trident poised,
guarded the seas. For this the boldly-announced sailing
list served as text, but Dick, who made allowances
for exuberant Latin sentiment, noted the captain&#8217;s response
with some surprise.
</p>
<p>His speech was flamboyant, and did not harmonize
with the character of the man, who had called at the
port before in command of another ship. He was
gray-haired and generally reserved. Dick had not expected
him to indulge in cheap patriotism, but he
called the British ensign the meteor flag, defied its
enemies, and declared that no hostile fleets could prevent
his employers carrying their engagements out.
Since the man was obviously sober, Dick supposed he
was touting for business and wanted to assure the merchants
that the sailings of the company&#8217;s steamers could
be relied upon. Still, this kind of thing was not good
British form.
</p>
<p>By and by Don Sebastian came down a ladder from
the saloon deck with Clare behind him. Dick felt
tempted to retire but conquered the impulse and the
Spaniard came up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have some business with the purser, who is waiting
for me, but cannot find my señora,&#8221; he explained,
and Dick, knowing that local conventions forbade his
leaving Clare alone, understood it as a request that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
he should take care of her until the other&#8217;s return.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be glad to stay with Miss Kenwardine,&#8221;
he answered with a bow, and when Don Sebastian went
off opened a deck-chair and turned to the girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see how I was situated!&#8221; he said awkwardly.
</p>
<p>Clare smiled as she sat down. &#8220;Yes; you are not
to blame. Indeed, I do not see why you should apologize.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;I hoped that I might meet
you, though I feared you would sooner I did not.
When I saw you on the ladder, I felt I ought to steal
away, but must confess that I was glad when I found
it was too late. Somehow, things seem to bring us
into opposition. They have done so from the beginning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re unnecessarily frank,&#8221; Clare answered with
a blush. &#8220;Since you couldn&#8217;t steal away, wouldn&#8217;t it
have been better not to hint that I was anxious to
avoid you? After all, I could have done so if I had
really wanted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect that&#8217;s true. Of course what happened
when we last met couldn&#8217;t trouble you as it troubled
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you trying to be tactful now?&#8221; Clare asked,
smiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; it&#8217;s my misfortune that I haven&#8217;t much tact.
If I had, I might be able to straighten matters out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you understand that they can&#8217;t be straightened
out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; Dick answered stubbornly. &#8220;For all
that, I won&#8217;t trouble you again until I find a way out
of the tangle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare gave him a quick, disturbed look. &#8220;It would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
be much better if you took it for granted that we
must, to some extent, be enemies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;m afraid your father and I are enemies,
but that&#8217;s not the same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is; you can see that it must be,&#8221; Clare insisted;
and then, as if anxious to change the subject, went
on: &#8220;He was too busy to bring me to-night so I
came with Don Sebastian and his wife. It is not very
gay in Santa Brigida and one gets tired of being
alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her voice fell a little as she concluded, and Dick,
who understood something of her isolation from
friends of her race, longed to take her in his arms and
comfort her. Indeed, had the quarter-deck been deserted
he might have tried, for he felt that her refusal
had sprung from wounded pride and a sense of duty.
There was something in her manner that hinted that
it had not been easy to send him away. Yet he saw
she could be firm and thought it wise to follow her
lead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then your father has been occupied lately,&#8221; he
remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; he is often away. He goes to Adexe and is
generally busy in the evenings. People come to see
him and keep him talking in his room. Our friends
no longer spend the evening in the patio.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick understood her. She wanted to convince him
that Kenwardine was a business man and only gambled
when he had nothing else to do. Indeed, her motive
was rather pitifully obvious, and Dick knew that he
had not been mistaken about her character. Clare
had, no doubt, once yielded to her father&#8217;s influence,
but it was impossible that she took any part in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
plots. She was transparently honest; he knew this
as he watched her color come and go.
</p>
<p>&#8220;After all, I don&#8217;t think you liked many of the people
who came,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I liked Jake,&#8221; she answered and stopped with a
blush, while Dick felt half ashamed, because he had
deprived her of the one companion she could trust.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t altogether my fault that
Jake doesn&#8217;t come to see you. We have had some
accidents that delayed the work and he has not been
able to leave the dam.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was silent for the next few minutes. Since
Clare was eager to defend Kenwardine, she might be
led to tell something about his doings from which a
useful hint could be gathered, and Dick greatly wished
to know who visited his house on business. Still, it
was impossible that he should make the girl betray her
father. The fight was between him and Kenwardine,
and Clare must be kept outside it. With this resolve,
he began to talk about the dancing, and soon afterward
Jake came up and asked Clare for the next waltz.
She smiled and gave Dick a challenging glance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; he said with a bow, and then turned
to Jake. &#8220;As Miss Kenwardine has been put in my
charge, you must bring her back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake grinned as he promised and remarked as they
went away: &#8220;Makes a good dueña, doesn&#8217;t he? You
can trust Dick to guard anything he&#8217;s told to take care
of. In fact, if I&#8217;d a sister I wanted to leave in safe
hands&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He paused and laughed. &#8220;But that&#8217;s
the trouble. It was my sister who told him to take
care of me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick did not hear Clare&#8217;s reply, but watched her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
dance until Don Sebastian&#8217;s wife came up. After that
he went away, and presently strolled along the highest
deck. This was narrower than the others, but was
extended as far as the side of the ship by beams on
which the boats were stowed. There were no rails,
for passengers were not allowed up there; but Dick,
who was preoccupied and moody, wanted to be alone.
The moon had now risen above the mountains and the
sea glittered between the shore and the ship. Looking
down, he saw a row of boats rise and fall with
the languid swell near her tall side, and the flash of
the surf that washed the end of the mole. Then, taking
out a cigarette, he strolled towards the captain&#8217;s
room, which stood behind the bridge, and stopped near
it in the shadow of a big lifeboat.
</p>
<p>The room was lighted, and the door and windows
were half open because the night was hot. Carelessly
glancing in, Dick saw Don Sebastian sitting at the
table with the captain and engineer. This somewhat
surprised him, for the purser transacted the ship&#8217;s
business and, so far as he knew, none of the other
guests had been taken to the captain&#8217;s room. He felt
puzzled about Don Sebastian, whom he had met once
or twice. The fellow had an air of authority and
the smaller officials treated him with respect.
</p>
<p>Something in the men&#8217;s attitude indicated that they
were talking confidentially, and Dick thought he had
better go away without attracting their attention; but
just then the captain turned in his chair and looked out.
Dick decided to wait until he looked round again, and
next moment Don Sebastian asked: &#8220;Have you
plenty coal?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; the engineer replied. &#8220;The after-bunkers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
are full, but I&#8217;d have taken a few extra barge-loads
here only I didn&#8217;t want any of the shore peons
to see how much I&#8217;d already got.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick did not understand this, because coal was
somewhat cheaper and the facilities for shipping it
were better at the boat&#8217;s next port of call, to which
it was only a two-days&#8217; run. Then the captain, who
turned to Don Sebastian, remarked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Making the sailing list prominent was a happy
thought, and it was lucky your friends backed us up
well by their speeches. You saw how I took advantage
of the lead they gave me, but I hope we haven&#8217;t
overdone the thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Don Sebastian thoughtfully; &#8220;I imagine
nobody suspects anything yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you had better clear the ship soon, sir,&#8221;
said the engineer. &#8220;Steam&#8217;s nearly up and it takes
some coal&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The room door slipped off its hook and swung wide
open as the vessel rolled, and Dick, who could not
withdraw unnoticed, decided to light his cigarette in
order that the others might see that they were not
alone. As he struck the match the captain got up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the foreign passengers, I expect; the mates
can&#8217;t keep them off this deck,&#8221; the engineer replied.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose the fellow knows English, but shall
I send him down?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not. It might look as if we were afraid
of being overheard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick held the match to his cigarette for a moment
or two before he threw it away, and as he walked
past noted that Don Sebastian had come out on deck.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
Indeed, he thought the man had seen his face and
was satisfied, because he turned back into the room.
Dick went down a ladder to the deck below, where he
stopped and thought over what he had heard. It was
plain that some precautions had been taken against
the risk of capture, but he could not understand why
Don Sebastian had been told about them.
</p>
<p>By and by he thought he would speak to the purser,
whom he knew, and went down the alleyway that led
to his office. The door was hooked back, but the
passage was narrow and a fat Spanish lady blocked
the entrance. She was talking to the purser and Dick
saw that he must wait until she had finished. A man
stood a few yards behind her, unscrewing a flute, and
as a folded paper that looked like music stuck out of
his pocket he appeared to belong to the band.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is Tuesday you arrive at Palomas!&#8221; the
lady exclaimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;About then,&#8221; the purser answered in awkward
Castilian. &#8220;We may be a little late.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how much late?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot tell. Perhaps a day or two.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At dinner the captain said&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so. But he was speaking generally without
knowing all the arrangements.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick could not see into the office, but heard the
purser open a drawer and shuffle some papers, as if
he wanted to get rid of his questioner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is necessary that I know when we arrive,&#8221; the
lady resumed. &#8220;If it is not Tuesday, I must send
a telegram.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The purser shut the drawer noisily, but just then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
a bell rang overhead and the whistle blew to warn the
visitors that they must go ashore.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you must be quick,&#8221; said the purser.
&#8220;Write your message here and give it to me. You
need not be disturbed. We will land you at Palomas.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lady entered the office, but Dick thought her
telegram would not be sent, and a moment later the
captain&#8217;s plan dawned on him. The ship would call
at the ports named, but not in the order stated, and
this was why she needed so much coal. She would
probably steam first to the port farthest off and then
work backward, and the sailing list was meant to put
the raider off the track. The latter&#8217;s commander,
warned by spies who would send him the list, would
think he knew where to find the vessel at any particular
date, when, however, she would be somewhere
else. Then Dick wondered why the musician was
hanging about, and went up to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The sobrecargo&#8217;s busy,&#8221; he said in English.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll be taken to sea unless you get up on deck.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I no wanta el sobrecargo,&#8221; the man replied in
a thick, stupid voice. &#8220;The music is thirsty; I wanta
drink.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The second-class bar was farther down the alleyway,
and Dick, indicating it, turned back and made
his way to the poop as fast as he could, for he did
not think the man was as drunk as he looked. He
found the musicians collecting their stands, and went
up to the bandmaster.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one of your men below who has been
drinking too much caña,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You had better
look after him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But they are all here,&#8221; the bandmaster answered,
glancing round the poop.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The man had a flute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we have no flute-player.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he must have been a passenger,&#8221; said Dick,
who hurried to the gangway.
</p>
<p>After hailing his fireman to bring the launch alongside,
he threw a quick glance about. The shore boatmen
were pushing their craft abreast of the ladder
and shouting as they got in each other&#8217;s way, but one
boat had already left the ship and was pulling fast
towards the harbor. There seemed to be only one
man on board besides her crew, and Dick had no doubt
that he was the flute-player. He must be followed,
since it was important to find out whom he met and
if, as Dick suspected, he meant to send off a telegram.
But the liner&#8217;s captain must be warned, and Dick
turned hastily around. The windlass was rattling and
the bridge, on which he could see the captain&#8217;s burly
figure, was some distance off, while the passage between
the gangway and deckhouse was blocked by the
departing guests.
</p>
<p>The anchor would probably be up before he could
push his way through the crowd, and if he was not
carried off to sea, he would certainly lose sight of the
spy. Writing a line or two on the leaf of his pocket-book,
he tore it out and held it near a Creole steward
boy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take that to the sobrecargo at once,&#8221; he cried, and
seeing the boy stoop to pick up the note, which fell
to the deck, ran down the ladder.
</p>
<p>He had, however, to wait a minute while the fireman
brought the launch alongside between the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
boats, and when they pushed off Don Sebastian, scrambling
across one of the craft, jumped on board. He
smiled when Dick looked at him with annoyed surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think my business is yours, but there is no time
for explanations,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Tell your man to go full
speed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The launch quivered and leaped ahead with the foam
curling at her bows, and Dick did not look round when
he heard an expostulating shout. Jake and Bethune
must get ashore as they could; his errand was too important
to stop for them, particularly as he could no
longer see the boat in front. She had crossed the
glittering belt of moonlight and vanished into the
shadow near the mole. Her occupant had had some
minutes&#8217; start and had probably landed, but it might
be possible to find out where he had gone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Screw the valve wide open,&#8221; Dick told the fireman.
</p>
<p>The rattle of the engine quickened a little, the launch
lifted her bows, and her stern sank into the hollow of
a following wave. When she steamed up the harbor
a boat lay near some steps, and as the launch slackened
speed Dick asked her crew which way their passenger
had gone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Up the mole, señor,&#8221; one answered breathlessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all you will learn from them,&#8221; Don Sebastian
remarked. &#8220;I think we will try the <i>telegrafia</i>
first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no time for questions and Dick jumped
out as the launch ran alongside the steps. Don Sebastian
stopped him when he reached the top.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In Santa Brigida, nobody runs unless there is an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
earthquake or a revolution. We do not want people
to follow us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick saw the force of this and started for the telegraph
office, walking as fast as possible. When he
looked round, his companion had vanished, but he rejoined
him on the steps of the building. They went
in together and found nobody except a languid clerk
leaning on a table. Don Sebastian turned to Dick and
said in English, &#8220;It will be better if you leave this
matter to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick noted that the clerk suddenly became alert
when he saw his companion, but he waited at a few
yards&#8217; distance and Don Sebastian said: &#8220;A man
came in not long since with a telegram. He was short
and very dark and probably signed the form Vinoles.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He did, señor,&#8221; said the clerk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. I want to see the message before it
is sent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It has gone, señor, three or four minutes ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Don Sebastian made a gesture of resignation,
spreading out his hands. &#8220;Then bring me the form.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick thought it significant that the clerk at once
obeyed, but Don Sebastian, who stood still for a moment,
turned to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is as I thought,&#8221; he said in English, and ordered
the clerk: &#8220;Take us into the manager&#8217;s room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The other did so, and after shutting the door withdrew.
Don Sebastian threw the form on the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems we are too late,&#8221; he said.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>THE WATER-PIPE</h3>
</div>

<p>Dick sat down and knitted his brows as he studied
his companion. Don Sebastian was a Peninsular
Spaniard and in consequence of a finer type than
the majority of the inhabitants of Santa Brigida.
Dick, who thought he could confide in him, needed
help, but the matter was delicate. In the meantime,
the other waited with a smile that implied that he
guessed his thoughts, until Dick, leaning forward with
sudden resolution, picked up the telegram, which was
written in cipher.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is probably a warning to somebody that the
vessel will not call at the ports in the advertised order,&#8221;
he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I imagine so. You guessed the captain&#8217;s plan
from what you heard outside the room?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not altogether, but it gave me a hint. It looks
as if you recognized me when I was standing near the
lifeboat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; said Don Sebastian meaningly. &#8220;I think
I showed my confidence in you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick nodded, because it was plain that the other had
enabled him to go away without being questioned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well; I&#8217;ll tell you what I know,&#8221; he said, and
related how he had found the man with the flute loitering
about the purser&#8217;s door. As he finished, Don Sebastian
got up.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You made one mistake; you should have given
your note to an Englishman and not a young Creole
lad. However, we must see if the steamer can be
stopped.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He led the way up a staircase to the flat roof, where
Dick ran to the parapet. Looking across the town,
he saw in the distance a dim white light and a long
smear of smoke that trailed across the glittering sea.
He frowned as he watched it, for the ship was English
and he felt himself responsible for the safety of
all on board her. He had done his best, when there
was no time to pause and think, but perhaps he had
blundered. Suppose the Creole boy had lost his note
or sent it to somebody ashore?
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are too late again,&#8221; Don Sebastian remarked
as he sat down on the parapet. &#8220;Well, one must be
philosophical. Things do not always go as one would
wish.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you warn the captain that his plan
was found out, instead of jumping into the launch?&#8221;
Dick asked angrily.
</p>
<p>Don Sebastian smiled. &#8220;Because I did not know.
I saw a man steal down the ladder and thought he
might be a spy, but could not tell how much he had
learned. If he had learned nothing, it would have
been dangerous for the captain to change his plan
again and keep to the sailing list.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; Dick agreed shortly. His chin was
thrust forward and his head slightly tilted back. He
looked very English and aggressive as he resumed:
&#8220;But I want to know what your interest in the matter
is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I must tell you. To begin with, I am employed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
by the Government and am in the President&#8217;s
confidence. The country is poor and depends for its
development on foreign capital, while it is important
that we should have the support and friendship of
Great Britain and the United States. Perhaps you
know the latter&#8217;s jealousy about European interference
in American affairs?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick nodded. &#8220;You feel you have to be careful.
But how far can a country go in harboring a belligerent&#8217;s
agents and supplying her fighting ships, without
losing its neutrality?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a difficult question,&#8221; Don Sebastian replied.
&#8220;I imagine the answer depends upon the temper of
the interested country&#8217;s diplomatic representatives;
but the President means to run no risks. We cannot,
for example, have it claimed that we allowed a foreign
power to buy a coaling station and use it as a base
for raids on merchant ships.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have the Germans bought the Adexe wharf?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Don Sebastian shrugged. &#8220;<i>Quién sabe?</i> The
principal has not a German name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t Richter German?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Richter has gone. It is possible that he has done
his work. His friend, however, is the head of the
coaling company.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think Kenwardine was his partner? If
so, it&#8217;s hard to understand why he let you come to his
house. He&#8217;s not a fool.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Spaniard&#8217;s dark eyes twinkled. &#8220;Señor Kenwardine
is a clever man, and it is not always safer to
keep your antagonist in the dark when you play an
intricate game. Señor Kenwardine knew it would
have been a mistake to show he thought I suspected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
him and that he had something to conceal. We were
both very frank, to a point, and now and then talked
about the complications that might spring from the
coaling business. Because we value our trade with
England and wish to attract British capital, he knew
we would not interfere with him unless we had urgent
grounds, and wished to learn how far we would let
him go. It must be owned that in this country official
suspicion can often be disarmed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By a bribe? I don&#8217;t think Kenwardine is rich,&#8221;
Dick objected.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it is curious that he is able to spend so much
at Adexe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick frowned, for he saw what the other implied.
If Kenwardine had to be supplied with money, where
did it come from? It was not his business to defend
the man and he must do what he could to protect British
shipping, but Kenwardine was Clare&#8217;s father, and
he was not going to expose him until he was sure of
his guilt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But if he was plotting anything that would get
your President into trouble, he must have known he
would be found out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. But suppose he imagined he might not
be found out until he had done what he came to do?
It would not matter then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick said nothing. He knew he was no match for
the Spaniard in subtlety, but he would not be forced
into helping him. He set his lips, and Don Sebastian
watched him with amusement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the latter, &#8220;you have my sympathy.
The señorita&#8217;s eyes are bright.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot have Miss Kenwardine mentioned,&#8221; Dick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
rejoined. &#8220;She has nothing to do with the matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is agreed,&#8221; Don Sebastian answered, and
leaned forward as he added in a meaning tone: &#8220;You
are English and your life has been threatened by men
who plot against your country. I might urge that
they may try again and I could protect you; but you
must see what their thinking you dangerous means.
Now I want your help.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick&#8217;s face was very resolute as he looked at him.
&#8220;If any harm comes to the liner, I&#8217;ll do all I can.
But I&#8217;ll do nothing until I know. In the meantime, can
you warn the captain?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Don Sebastian bowed. &#8220;I must be satisfied with
your promise. We may find the key to the telegram,
and must try to get into communication with the
steamer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They went down stairs together, but the Spaniard
did not leave the office with Dick, who went out alone
and found Bethune and Jake waiting at the end of
the line. They bantered him about his leaving them
on board the ship, but although he thought Jake looked
at him curiously, he told them nothing.
</p>
<p>When work stopped on the Saturday evening, Jake
and Dick went to dine with Bethune. It was getting
dark when they reached a break in the dam, where a
gap had been left open while a sluice was being built.
A half-finished tower rose on the other side and a rope
ladder hung down for the convenience of anybody who
wished to cross. A large iron pipe that carried water
to a turbine, however, spanned the chasm, and the
sure-footed peons often used it as a bridge. This required
some agility and nerve, but it saved an awkward
scramble across the sluice and up the concrete.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s just light enough,&#8221; Jake remarked, and
balancing himself carefully, walked out upon the pipe.
</p>
<p>Dick followed and getting across safely, stopped
at the foot of the tower and looked down at the rough
blocks and unfinished ironwork in the bottom of the
gap.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The men have been told to use the ladder, but as
they seldom do so, it would be safer to run a wire
across for a hand-rail,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Anybody who
slipped would get a dangerous fall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They went on to Bethune&#8217;s iron shack, where Stuyvesant
joined them, and after dinner sat outside, talking
and smoking. A carafe of Spanish wine and some
glasses stood on a table close by.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve fired Jose&#8217;s and Pancho&#8217;s gangs; they&#8217;ve been
asking for it for some time,&#8221; Stuyvesant remarked.
&#8220;In fact, I&#8217;d clear out most of the shovel boys if I
could replace them. They&#8217;ve been saving money and
are getting slack.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The others agreed that it might be advisable. The
half-breeds from the hills, attracted by good wages,
worked well when first engaged, but generally found
steady labor irksome and got discontented when they
had earned a sum that would enable them to enjoy a
change.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d get boys enough in this neighborhood,&#8221;
Bethune said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. Anyhow, I&#8217;d rather hire a less sophisticated
crowd; the half-civilized <i>Meztiso</i> is worse than
the other sort, but I don&#8217;t see why we shouldn&#8217;t look
for some further along the coast. Do you feel like
taking the launch, Brandon, and trying what you can
do?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d enjoy the trip,&#8221; Dick answered with some hesitation.
&#8220;But I&#8217;d probably have to go beyond Coronal,
and it might take a week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t matter; stay as long as it&#8217;s necessary,&#8221;
Stuyvesant said, for he had noticed a slackness in
Dick&#8217;s movements and his tired look. &#8220;Things are
going pretty well just now, and you have stuck close
to your work. The change will brace you up. Anyhow,
I want fresh boys and Bethune&#8217;s needed here,
but you can take Jake along if you want company.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake declared that he would go, but Dick agreed
with reluctance. He felt jaded and depressed, for the
double strain he had borne was beginning to tell. His
work, carried on in scorching heat, demanded continuous
effort, and when it stopped at night he had private
troubles to grapple with. Though he had been half-prepared
for Clare&#8217;s refusal, it had hit him hard, and
he could find no means of exposing Kenwardine&#8217;s
plots without involving her in his ruin. It would be a
relief to get away, but he might be needed at Santa
Brigida.
</p>
<p>Bethune began to talk about the alterations a contractor
wished to make, and by and by there was a
patter of feet and a hum of voices in the dark. The
voices grew louder and sounded angry as the steps
approached the house, and Stuyvesant pushed back his
chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Jose&#8217;s or Pancho&#8217;s breeds come to claim that
their time is wrong. I suppose one couldn&#8217;t expect
that kind of crowd to understand figures, but although
François&#8217; accounts are seldom very plain, he&#8217;s not a
grafter.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></p>
<p>Then a native servant entered hurriedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They all come, señor,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;Pig tief
say Fransoy rob him and he go casser office window.&#8221;
He turned and waved his hand threateningly as a big
man in ragged white clothes came into the light.
&#8220;<i>Fuera, puerco ladron!</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man took off a large palm-leaf hat and flourished
it with ironical courtesy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is gran escandolo, señores. <i>La belle chose,
verdad!</i> Me I have trent&#8217; dollar; the grand tief me
pay&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stuyvesant signed to the servant. &#8220;Take them
round to the back corral; we can&#8217;t have them on the
veranda.&#8221; Then he turned to Dick. &#8220;You and
Bethune must convince them that the time-sheets are
right; you know more about the thing than I do.
Haven&#8217;t you been helping François, Fuller?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a linguist,&#8221; Jake answered with a grin.
&#8220;When they talk French and Spanish at once it knocks
me right off my height, as François sometimes declares.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They all went round to the back of the house, where
Bethune and Dick argued with the men. The latter
had been dismissed and while ready to go wanted a
grievance, though some honestly failed to understand
the deductions from their wages. They had drawn
small sums in advance, taken goods out of store, and
laid off now and then on an unusually hot day, but
the amount charged against them was larger than they
thought. For all that, Bethune using patience and
firmness pacified them, and after a time they went
away satisfied while the others returned to the
veranda.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Arguing in languages you don&#8217;t know well is
thirsty work, and we&#8217;d better have a drink,&#8221; Bethune
remarked.
</p>
<p>He pushed the carafe across the table, but Dick
picked up his glass, which he had left about half full.
He was hot and it was a light Spanish wine that one
could drink freely, but when he had tasted it he emptied
what was left over the veranda rails.
</p>
<p>Bethune looked surprised, but laughed. &#8220;The wine
isn&#8217;t very good, but the others seem able to stand for
it. I once laid out a mine ditch in a neighborhood
where you&#8217;d have wanted some courage to throw away
a drink the boys had given you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very bad manners,&#8221; Dick answered awkwardly.
&#8220;Still, I didn&#8217;t like the taste&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stopped, noticing that Jake gave him a keen
glance, but Stuyvesant filled his glass and drank.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with the wine?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>Dick hesitated. He wanted to let the matter drop,
but he had treated Bethune rudely and saw that the
others were curious.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It didn&#8217;t taste as it did when I left it. Of course
this may have been imagination.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t think so?&#8221; Stuyvesant rejoined.
&#8220;In fact, you suspect the wine was doped after we
went out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Dick with a puzzled frown; &#8220;I imagine
any doping stuff would make it sour. The curious
thing is that it tasted better than usual but stronger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stuyvesant picked up the glass and smelt it, for a
little of the liquor remained in the bottom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity you threw it out, because there&#8217;s a scent
mine hasn&#8217;t got. Like bad brandy or what the Spaniards
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
call <i>madre de vino</i> and use for bringing light
wine up to strength.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Bethune took the glass from him and drained
the last drops. &#8220;I think it <i>is madre de vino</i>. Pretty
heady stuff and that glass would hold a lot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stuyvesant nodded, for it was not a wineglass but
a small tumbler.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Doping&#8217;s not an unusual trick, but I can&#8217;t see
why anybody should want to make Brandon <i>drunk</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t very plain and I may have made a fuss
about nothing,&#8221; Dick replied, and began to talk about
something else with Jake&#8217;s support.
</p>
<p>The others indulged them, and after a time the party
broke up. The moon had risen when Dick and Jake
walked back along the dam, but the latter stopped when
they reached the gap.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll climb down and cross by the sluice instead
of the pipe,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Dick asked. &#8220;The light is better than
when we came.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake gave him a curious look. &#8220;Your nerve&#8217;s
pretty good, but do you want to defy your enemies
and show them you have found out their trick?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I haven&#8217;t found it out; that is, I don&#8217;t know
the object of it yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jake rather grimly, &#8220;what do you
think would happen if a drunken man tried to walk
along that pipe?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then a light dawned on Dick and he sat down,
feeling limp. He was abstemious, and a large dose of
strong spirit would, no doubt, have unsteadied him.
His companions would notice this, but with the obstinacy
that often marks a half-drunk man he would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
probably have insisted on trying to cross the pipe.
Then a slip or hesitation would have precipitated him
upon the unfinished ironwork below, and since an obvious
explanation of his fall had been supplied, nobody&#8217;s
suspicions would have been aroused. The
subtlety of the plot was unnerving. Somebody who
knew all about him had chosen the moment well.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so devilishly clever!&#8221; he said with hoarse
anger after a moment or two.
</p>
<p>Jake nodded. &#8220;They&#8217;re smart. They knew the
boys were coming to make a row and Stuyvesant
wouldn&#8217;t have them on the veranda. Then the wine
was on the table, and anybody who&#8217;d noticed where
we sat could tell your glass. It would have been easy
to creep up to the shack before the moon rose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are <i>they</i>?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I knew, I could tell you what to do about it,
but I don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s possible there was only one man,
but if so, he&#8217;s dangerous. Anyhow, it&#8217;s obvious that
Kenwardine has no part in the matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not in this,&#8221; Dick agreed. &#8220;Have you a
cigarette? I think I&#8217;d like a smoke. It doesn&#8217;t follow
that I&#8217;d have been killed, if I had fallen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;d certainly have got hurt enough to
keep you quiet for some time, which would probably
satisfy the other fellow. But I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll stop
here talking; there may be somebody about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They climbed down by the foot of the tower and
crossing the sluice went up the ladder. When they
reached their shack Dick sat down and lighted the
cigarette Jake had given him, but he said nothing and
his face was sternly set. Soon afterwards he went to
bed.

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>THE LINER&#8217;S FATE</h3>
</div>

<p>Next morning Dick reviewed the situation as he
ate his breakfast in the fresh coolness before
the sun got up. He had got a shock, but he was young
and soon recovered. His anger against the unknown
plotter remained fierce, but this was, in a sense, a
private grievance, by which he must not be unduly
influenced. It was plain that he was thought dangerous,
which showed that he was following the right
clue, and he had determined that the raiding of ships
belonging to Britain or her allies must be stopped.
Since he had gone to the representative of British authority
and had been rebuffed, he meant to get Fuller
to see if American suspicions could be easier aroused,
but he must first make sure of his ground. In the
meantime, Don Sebastian had asked his help and he
had given a conditional promise.
</p>
<p>Dick decided that he had taken the proper course.
Don Sebastian held Kenwardine accountable and
meant to expose him. This was painful to contemplate
for Clare&#8217;s sake, but Dick admitted that he could
not shield Kenwardine at his country&#8217;s expense. Still,
the matter was horribly complicated. If Kenwardine
was ruined or imprisoned, a serious obstacle in Dick&#8217;s
way would be removed, but it was unthinkable that
this should be allowed to count when Clare must suffer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
Besides, she might come to hate him if she
learned that he was responsible for her father&#8217;s
troubles. But he would make the liner&#8217;s fate a test.
If the vessel arrived safe, Kenwardine should go free
until his guilt was certain; if she were sunk or chased,
he would help Don Sebastian in every way he could.
</p>
<p>For three or four days he heard nothing about her,
and then, one hot morning, when Stuyvesant and
Bethune stood at the foot of the tower by the sluice
examining some plans, Jake crossed the pipe with a
newspaper in his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The <i>Diario</i> has just arrived,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t
tried to read it yet, but the liner has been attacked.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick, who was superintending the building of the
sluice, hastily scrambled up the bank, and Stuyvesant,
taking the newspaper, sat down in the shade of the
tower. He knew more Castilian than the others, who
gathered round him as he translated.
</p>
<p>The liner, the account stated, had the coast in sight
shortly before dark and was steaming along it when
a large, black funnel steamer appeared from behind
a point. The captain at once swung his vessel round
and the stranger fired a shot, of which he took no
notice. It was blowing fresh, the light would soon
fade, and there was a group of reefs, which he knew
well, not far away. The raider gained a little during
the next hour and fired several shots. Two of the
shells burst on board, killing a seaman and wounding
some passengers, but the captain held on. When it
was getting dark the reefs lay close ahead, with the
sea breaking heavily on their outer edge, but he steamed
boldly for an intricate, unmarked channel between
them and the land. In altering his course, he exposed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
the vessel&#8217;s broadside to the enemy and a shot smashed
the pilot-house, but they steered her in with the hand-gear.
The pursuer then sheered off, but it got very
dark and the vessel grounded in a position where the
reef gave some shelter.
</p>
<p>Nothing could be done until morning, but as day
broke the raider reappeared and had fired a shot across
the reef when a gunboat belonging to the state in
whose territorial waters the steamer lay came upon the
scene. She steamed towards the raider, which made
off at full speed. Then the gunboat took the liner&#8217;s
passengers on board, and it was hoped that the vessel
could be re-floated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A clear story, told by a French or Spanish sailor
who&#8217;d taken a passage on the ship,&#8221; Bethune remarked.
&#8220;It certainly didn&#8217;t come from one of the British
crew.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Jake asked.
</p>
<p>Bethune smiled. &#8220;A seaman who tells the truth
about anything startling that happens on board a passenger
boat gets fired. The convention is to wrap the
thing in mystery, if it can&#8217;t be denied. Besides, the
ability to take what you might call a quick, bird&#8217;s-eye
view isn&#8217;t a British gift; an Englishman would have
concentrated on some particular point. Anyhow, I
can&#8217;t see how the boat came to be where she was at
the time mentioned.&#8221; He turned to Dick and asked:
&#8220;Do you know, Brandon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Dick, shortly, &#8220;not altogether.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; resumed Bethune, &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen the antiquated
gunboat that came to the rescue, and it&#8217;s amusing
to think of her steaming up to the big auxiliary
cruiser. It&#8217;s doubtful if they&#8217;ve got ammunition that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
would go off in their footy little guns, though I expect
the gang of half-breed cut-throats would put up
a good fight. They have pluck enough, and the country
they belong to can stand upon her dignity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She knows where to look for support,&#8221; Stuyvesant
remarked. &#8220;If the other party goes much farther,
she&#8217;ll get a sharp snub up. What&#8217;s your idea of the
situation?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Something like yours. We can&#8217;t allow the black
eagle to find an eyrie in this part of the world, but
just now our Western bird&#8217;s talons are blunt. She
hasn&#8217;t been rending the innocents like the other, but
one or two of our former leaders are anxious to put
her into fighting trim, and I dare say something of the
kind will be done. However, Brandon hasn&#8217;t taken
much part in this conversation. I guess he&#8217;s thinking
about his work!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick, who had been sitting quiet with a thoughtful
face, got up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to talk to you for a few minutes, Stuyvesant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the other, who turned to Bethune
and Jake. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to play the domineering
boss, but we&#8217;re not paid to sit here and fix up international
politics.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They went away and Stuyvesant looked at Dick who
said, &#8220;I ought to start in the launch to-morrow to
get the laborers you want, but I can&#8217;t go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick hesitated. &#8220;The fact is I&#8217;ve something else
to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Stuyvesant. &#8220;I think the understanding
was that Fuller bought all your time.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He did. I&#8217;m sorry, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But if I insist on your going down the coast,
you&#8217;ll break your agreement.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Dick with embarrassment. &#8220;It comes
to that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stuyvesant looked hard at him. &#8220;You must recognize
that this is a pretty good job, and you&#8217;re not likely
to get another without Fuller&#8217;s recommendation.
Then I understand you were up against it badly when
he first got hold of you. You&#8217;re young and ought to
be ambitious, and you have your chance to make your
mark right here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all true,&#8221; Dick answered doggedly. &#8220;Still, I
can&#8217;t go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it must be something very important that
makes you willing to throw up your job.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick did not answer and, to his surprise, Stuyvesant
smiled as he resumed: &#8220;It&#8217;s England first, with
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you guess? How much do you know?&#8221;
Dick asked sharply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know very much. Your throwing out the
wine gave me a hint, because it was obvious that somebody
had been getting after you before, and there were
other matters. But you&#8217;re rather young and I suspect
you&#8217;re up against a big thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t tell you about it yet, if that
is what you mean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. Stay here, as usual, if you like, or if
you want a week off, take it. I&#8217;ll find a suitable reason
for not sending you in the launch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks!&#8221; said Dick, with keen gratitude, and
Stuyvesant, who nodded pleasantly, went away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></p>
<p>Dick sent a note to Don Sebastian by a messenger
he could trust, and soon after dark met him, as he
appointed, at a wine-shop on the outskirts of the town,
where they were shown into a small back room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I imagine you are now satisfied,&#8221; the Spaniard
said. &#8220;The liner has been chased and people on board
her have been killed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready to do anything that will prevent another
raid. To some extent, perhaps, I&#8217;m responsible for
what has happened; I might have stopped and seen
the mate or captain, but then I&#8217;d have lost the man I
was after. What do you think became of my
note?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Don Sebastian looked thoughtful. &#8220;The boy may
have lost it or shown it to his comrades; they carry
a few Spanish stewards for the sake of the foreign
passengers, and we both carelessly took too much for
granted. We followed the spy we saw without reflecting
that there might be another on board. However,
this is not important now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t. But what do you mean to do with Kenwardine?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have no cause for troubling yourself on his
account.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true, in a way,&#8221; Dick answered, coloring,
though his tone was resolute. &#8220;He once did me a
serious injury, but I don&#8217;t want him hurt. I mean
to stop his plotting if I can, but I&#8217;m going no further,
whether it&#8217;s my duty or not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Spaniard made a sign of comprehension.
&#8220;Then we need not quarrel about Kenwardine. In
fact, the President does not want to arrest him; our
policy is to avoid complications and it would satisfy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
us if he could be forced to leave the country and give
up the coaling station.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How will you force him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has been getting letters from Kingston; ordinary,
friendly letters from a gentleman whose business
seems to be coaling ships. For all that, there is
more in them than meets the uninstructed eye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you read his replies?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Don Sebastian shrugged. &#8220;What do you expect?
They do not tell us much, but it looks as if Señor Kenwardine
means to visit Kingston soon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s in Jamaica; British territory.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; said the Spaniard, smiling. &#8220;Señor
Kenwardine is a bold and clever man. His going to
Kingston would have thrown us off the scent if we
had not known as much as we do; but it would have
been dangerous had he tried to hide it and we had
found it out. You see how luck favors us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your plan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will follow Kenwardine. He will be more
or less at our mercy on British soil, and, if it seems
needful, there is a charge you can bring against him.
He stole some army papers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick started. &#8220;How did you hear of that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Clever men are sometimes incautious, and he once
spoke about it to his daughter,&#8221; Don Sebastian answered
with a shrug. &#8220;Our antagonists are not the
only people who have capable spies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The intrigue and trickery he had become entangled
in inspired Dick with disgust, but he admitted that one
could not be fastidious in a fight with a man like his
antagonist.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said, frowning, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go; but it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
must be understood that when he&#8217;s beaten you won&#8217;t
decide what&#8217;s to be done with the man without consulting
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Don Sebastian bowed. &#8220;It is agreed. One can
trust you to do nothing that would injure your country.
But we have some arrangements to make.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards Dick left the wine-shop, and
returning to the camp went to see Stuyvesant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to go away in a few days, perhaps for a
fortnight, but I&#8217;d like it understood that I&#8217;d been sent
down the coast in the launch,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As a matter
of fact, I mean to start in her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. Arrange the thing as you like,&#8221; Stuyvesant
agreed. Then he looked at Dick with a twinkle.
&#8220;You deserve a lay-off and I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick thanked him and went back to his shack, where
he found Jake on the verandah.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I may go with the launch, after all, but not to
Coronal,&#8221; he remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Jake, with some dryness. &#8220;Then you
had better take me; anyhow, I&#8217;m coming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d much sooner you didn&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t count,&#8221; Jake replied. &#8220;You&#8217;re getting
after somebody, and if you leave me behind, I&#8217;ll
give the plot away. It&#8217;s easy to send a rumor round
the camp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick reflected. He saw that Jake meant to come
and knew he could be obstinate. Besides, the lad was
something of a seaman and would be useful on board
the launch, because Dick did not mean to join the
steamer Kenwardine traveled by, but to catch another
at a port some distance off.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I suppose I must give in.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to,&#8221; Jake rejoined, and added in a
meaning tone: &#8220;You may need a witness if you&#8217;re
after Kenwardine, and I want to be about to see fair
play.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you trust the fellow yet?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Jake answered thoughtfully. &#8220;At
first, I thought Kenwardine great, and I like him now.
He certainly has charm and you can&#8217;t believe much
against him when he&#8217;s with you; but it&#8217;s somehow different
at a distance. Still, he knew nothing about
the attacks on you. I saw that when I told him about
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You told him!&#8221; Dick exclaimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did. Perhaps it might have been wise&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake stopped, for he heard a faint rustle, as if a
bush had been shaken, and Dick looked up. The
moon had not yet risen, thin mist drifted out of the
jungle, and it was very dark. There was some brush
in front of the building and a belt of tall grass and
reeds grew farther back. Without moving the upper
part of his body, he put his foot under the table at
which they sat and kicked Jake&#8217;s leg.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What was that about Adexe?&#8221; he asked in a clear
voice, and listened hard.
</p>
<p>He heard nothing then, for Jake took the hint and
began to talk about the coaling station, but when the
lad stopped there was another rustle, very faint but
nearer.
</p>
<p>Next moment a pistol shot rang out and a puff of
acrid smoke drifted into the veranda. Then the
brushwood crackled, as if a man had violently plunged
through it, and Jake sprang to his feet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come on and bring the lamp!&#8221; he shouted, running
down the steps.
</p>
<p>Dick followed, but left the lamp alone. He did not
know who had fired the shot and it might be imprudent
to make himself conspicuous. Jake, who was a few
yards in front, boldly took a narrow path through the
brush, which rose to their shoulders. The darkness
was thickened by the mist, but after a moment or two
they heard somebody coming to meet them. It could
hardly be an enemy, because the man wore boots and
his tread was quick and firm. Dick noted this with
some relief, but thought it wise to take precautions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on, Jake,&#8221; he said and raised his voice:
&#8220;Who&#8217;s that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Payne,&#8221; answered the other, and they waited until
he came up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Jake rather sharply, &#8220;what was the
shooting about?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a breed hanging round in the bushes
and when he tried to creep up to the veranda I
plugged him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then where is he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Payne answered
apologetically. &#8220;I hit him sure, but it looks as if he&#8217;d
got away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks as if you&#8217;d missed. Where did you shoot
from?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Payne beckoned them to follow and presently
stopped beside the heap of ironwork a little to one
side of the shack. The lighted veranda was in full
view of the spot, but there was tall brushwood close
by and behind this the grass.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I was here,&#8221; Payne explained. &#8220;Heard something
move once or twice, and at last the fellow showed
between me and the light. When I saw he was making
for the veranda I put up my gun. Knew I had
the bead on him when I pulled her off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then show us where he was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Payne led them forward until they reached a spot
where the brush was broken and bent, and Jake, stooping
down, struck a match.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess he&#8217;s right. Look at this,&#8221; he said with
shrinking in his voice.
</p>
<p>The others saw a red stain on the back of his hand
and crimson splashes on the grass. Then Dick took
the match and put it out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The fellow must be found. I&#8217;ll get two or three
of the boys I think we can trust and we&#8217;ll begin the
search at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He left them and returned presently with the men
and two lanterns, but before they set off he asked
Payne: &#8220;Could you hear what we said on the veranda?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I could tell you were talking, but that was
all. Once you kind of raised your voice and I guess
the fellow in front heard something, for it was then
he got up and tried to crawl close in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; Dick agreed and looked at Jake as one
of the men lighted a lantern. &#8220;He was nearer us
than Payne. I thought Adexe would draw him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They searched the belt of grass and the edge of the
jungle, since, as there were venomous snakes about,
it did not seem likely that the fugitive would venture
far into the thick, steamy gloom. Then they made a
circuit of the camp, stopping wherever a mound of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
rubbish offered a hiding-place, but the search proved
useless until they reached the head of the track. Then
an explanation of the man&#8217;s escape was supplied, for
the hand-car, which had stood there an hour ago, had
gone. A few strokes of the crank would start it,
after which it would run down the incline.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s how he went,&#8221; said Payne.
</p>
<p>Dick nodded. The car would travel smoothly if
its speed was controlled, but it would make some noise
and he could not remember having heard anything.
The peons, however, frequently used the car when they
visited their comrades at the mixing sheds, and he
supposed the rattle of wheels had grown so familiar
that he had not noticed it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Send the boys away; there&#8217;s nothing more to be
done,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>They turned back towards the shack, and after a
few minutes Jake remarked: &#8220;It will be a relief when
this business is over. My nerves are getting ragged.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>THE SILVER CLASP</h3>
</div>

<p>It was about eleven o&#8217;clock on a hot morning and
Kenwardine, who had adopted native customs,
was leisurely getting his breakfast in the patio. Two
or three letters lay among the fruit and wine, but he
did not mean to open them yet. He was something
of a sybarite and the letters might blunt his enjoyment
of the well-served meal. Clare, who had not eaten
much, sat opposite, watching him. His pose as he
leaned back with a wineglass in his hand was negligently
graceful, and his white clothes, drawn in at
the waist by a black silk sash, showed his well-knit
figure. There were touches of gray in his hair and
wrinkles round his eyes, but in spite of this he had a
look of careless youth. Clare, however, thought she
noticed a hint of preoccupation that she knew and
disliked.
</p>
<p>Presently Kenwardine picked out an envelope with
a British stamp from among the rest and turned it
over before inserting a knife behind the flap, which
yielded easily, as if the gum had lost its strength.
Then he took out the letter and smiled with ironical
amusement. If it had been read by any unauthorized
person before it reached him, the reader would have
been much misled, but it told him what he wanted to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
know. There was one word an Englishman or American
would not have used, though a Teuton might have
done so, but Kenwardine thought a Spaniard would
not notice this, even if he knew English well. The
other letters were not important, and he glanced at his
daughter.
</p>
<p>Clare was not wearing well. She had lost her color
and got thin. The climate was enervating, and Englishwomen
who stayed in the country long felt it more
than men, but this did not quite account for her jaded
look.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid you are feeling the hot weather, and
perhaps you have been indoors too much,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I must try to take you about more when I come
back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you are going away! Where to?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kenwardine would have preferred to hide his destination,
but since this would be difficult it seemed safer
not to try and there was no reason why his household
should not know.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To Jamaica. I have some business in Kingston,
but it won&#8217;t keep me long.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you take me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; said Kenwardine, who knew his visit
would be attended by some risk. &#8220;For one thing, I&#8217;ll
be occupied all the time, and as I must get back as
soon as possible, may have to travel by uncomfortable
boats. You will be safe with Lucille.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; Clare agreed with languid resignation.
&#8220;Still, I would have liked a change.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kenwardine showed no sign of yielding and she said
nothing more. She had chosen to live with him, and
although she had not known all that the choice implied,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
must obey his wishes. For all that, she longed to get
away. It had cost her more than she thought to refuse
Dick, and she felt that something mysterious and
disturbing was going on. Kenwardine&#8217;s carelessness
had not deceived her; she had watched him when he
was off his guard and knew that he was anxious.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t like Santa Brigida?&#8221; he suggested.
&#8220;Well, if things go as I hope, I may soon be able to
sell out my business interests and leave the country.
Would that please you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare&#8217;s eyes sparkled with satisfaction. Now there
was a prospect of its ending, she could allow herself
to admit how repugnant the life she led had grown.
She had hated the gambling, and although this had
stopped, the mystery and hidden intrigue that followed
it were worse. If her father gave it all up, they need
no longer be outcasts, and she could live as an English
girl ought to do. Besides, it would be easier to forget
Dick Brandon when she went away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would we go back to England?&#8221; she asked
eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly think that would be possible,&#8221; Kenwardine
replied. &#8220;We might, however, fix upon one of
the quieter cities near the Atlantic coast of America.
I know two or three that are not too big and are
rather old-fashioned, with something of the charm
of the Colonial days, where I think you might find
friends that would suit your fastidious taste.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare tried to look content. Of late, she had longed
for the peaceful, well-ordered life of the English
country towns, but it seemed there was some reason
they could not go home.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any place would be better than Santa Brigida,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
she said. &#8220;But I must leave you to your letters. I
am going out to buy some things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The sun was hot when she left the patio, but there
was a strip of shade on one side of the street and she
kept close to the wall, until turning a corner, she
entered a blaze of light. The glare from the pavement
and white houses was dazzling and she stopped
awkwardly, just in time to avoid collision with a man.
He stood still and she looked down as she saw that
it was Dick and noted the satisfaction in his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I wasn&#8217;t keeping a very good lookout,&#8221;
he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You seemed to be in a hurry,&#8221; Clare rejoined, half
hoping he would go on; but as he did not, she resumed:
&#8220;However, you generally give one the impression
of having something important to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick laughed. &#8220;That&#8217;s wrong just now, because
I&#8217;m killing time. I&#8217;ve an hour to wait before the
launch is ready to go to sea.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you are sailing somewhere along the coast,&#8221;
said Clare, who moved forward, and Dick taking
her permission for granted, turned and walked by her
side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I left Jake at the mole, putting provisions
on board.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks as if you would be away some time,&#8221;
Clare remarked carelessly.
</p>
<p>Dick thought she was not interested and felt relieved.
It had been announced at the irrigation camp that he
was going to Coronal to engage workmen, in order
that the report might reach Kenwardine. He had now
an opportunity of sending the latter misleading news,
but he could not make use of Clare in this way.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I expect so, but can&#8217;t tell yet when we will be
back,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Clare, &#8220;I shall feel that I am left alone.
My father is going to Kingston and doesn&#8217;t know when
he will return. Then you and Mr. Fuller&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>She stopped with a touch of embarrassment, wondering
whether she had said too much, but Dick
looked at her gravely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you will miss us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she admitted with a blush. &#8220;I suppose I
shall, in a sense. After all, I really know nobody in
Santa Brigida; that is, nobody I like. Of course, we
haven&#8217;t seen either of you often, but then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You liked to feel we were within call if we were
wanted? Well, I wish I could put off our trip, but
I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s impossible now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be absurd,&#8221; Clare answered, smiling,
and they went on in silence for the next few minutes.
</p>
<p>She felt that she had shown her feelings with raw
candor, and the worst was that Dick was right.
Though he thought she had robbed him, and was somehow
her father&#8217;s enemy, she did like to know he was
near. Then there had been something curious in his
tone and he had asked her nothing about her father&#8217;s
voyage. Indeed, it looked as if he meant to avoid
the subject, although politeness demanded some remark.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going shopping at the Almacen Morales,&#8221;
she said by and by, giving him an excuse to leave her
if he wished.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;ll come too. It will
be out of this blazing sun, and there are a few things
Jake told me to get.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></p>
<p>It was a relief to enter the big, cool, general store,
but when Clare went to the dry-goods counter Dick
turned aside to make his purchases. After this, he
strolled about, examining specimens of native feather-work,
and was presently seized by an inspiration as he
stopped beside some Spanish lace. Clare ought to
wear fine lace. The intricate, gauzy web would
harmonize with her delicate beauty, but the trouble
was that he was no judge of the material. A little
farther on, a case of silver filigree caught his eye and
he turned over some of the articles. This was work
he knew more about, and it was almost as light and
fine as the lace. The design was good and marked
by a fantastic Eastern grace, for it had come from
the Canaries and the Moors had taught the Spaniards
how to make it long ago. After some deliberation,
Dick chose a belt-clasp in a box by itself, and the girl
who had been waiting on him called a clerk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a good eye, señor,&#8221; the man remarked.
&#8220;The clasp was meant for a sample and not for sale.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Making things is my business and I know when
they&#8217;re made well,&#8221; Dick answered modestly. &#8220;Anyhow,
I want the clasp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The clerk said they would let him have it because
he sometimes bought supplies for the camp, and Dick
put the case in his pocket. Then he waited until Clare
was ready and left the store with her. He had bought
the clasp on an impulse, but now feared that she might
not accept his gift. After a time, he took it out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This caught my eye and I thought you might wear
it,&#8221; he said with diffidence.
</p>
<p>Clare took the open case, for at first the beauty of
the pattern seized her attention. Then she hesitated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
and turned to him with some color in her face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very pretty, but why do you want to give
it to me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To begin with, the thing has an airy lightness that
ought to suit you. Then you took care of me and we
were very good friends when I was ill. I&#8217;d like to
feel I&#8217;d given you something that might remind you
of this. Besides, you see, I&#8217;m going away&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are coming back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but things might happen in the meantime.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of things?&#8221; Clare asked in vague
alarm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Dick said awkwardly. &#8220;Still, disturbing
things do happen. Anyhow won&#8217;t you take
the clasp?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare stood irresolute with the case in her hand. It
was strange, and to some extent embarrassing that
Dick should insist upon making her the present. He
had humiliated her and it was impossible that she
could marry him, but there was an appeal in his eyes
that was hard to deny. Besides, the clasp was beautiful
and he had shown nice taste in choosing it for
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; she said gently. &#8220;I will keep it and
wear it now and then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick made a sign of gratitude and they went on,
but Clare stopped at the next corner and held out her
hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must not take you any farther,&#8221; she said firmly.
&#8220;I wish you a good voyage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She went into a shop and Dick turned back to the
harbor where he boarded the launch. The boat was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
loaded deep with coal, the fireman was busy, and soon
after the provisions Dick had bought arrived, steam
was up. He took the helm, the engine began to throb,
and they glided through the cool shadow along the
mole. When they met the smooth swell at the harbor
mouth the sea blazed with reflected light, and Dick
was glad to fix his eyes upon the little compass in the
shade of the awning astern. The boat lurched away
across the long undulations, with the foam curling up
about her bow and rising aft in a white following
wave.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought of leaving the last few bags of coal,&#8221;
Jake remarked. &#8220;There&#8217;s not much life in her and
we take some chances of being washed off if she meets
a breaking sea.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long run and we&#8217;ll soon burn down the coal,
particularly as we&#8217;ll have to drive her hard to catch
the Danish boat,&#8221; Dick replied. &#8220;If we can do that,
we&#8217;ll get Kenwardine&#8217;s steamer at her last port of call.
It&#8217;s lucky she isn&#8217;t going direct to Kingston.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have cut things rather fine, but I suppose you
worked it out from the sailing lists. The worst is
that following the coast like this takes us off our
course.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick nodded. After making some calculations with
Don Sebastian&#8217;s help, he had found it would be possible
to catch a small Danish steamer that would take
them to a port at which Kenwardine&#8217;s boat would arrive
shortly afterwards. But since it had been given
out that he was going to Coronal, he must keep near
the coast until he passed Adexe. This was necessary,
because Kenwardine would not risk a visit to Jamaica,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
which was British territory, if he thought he was being
followed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll make it all right if the weather keeps fine,&#8221;
he answered.
</p>
<p>They passed Adexe in the afternoon and boldly
turned seawards across a wide bay. At sunset the
coast showed faintly in the distance, obscured by the
evening mist, and the land breeze began to blow. It
was hot and filled with strange, sour and spicy smells,
and stirred the sea into short, white ripples that rapidly
got larger. They washed across the boat&#8217;s half-immersed
stern and now and then splashed on board at
her waist; but Dick kept the engine going full speed
and sat at the tiller with his eyes fixed upon the compass.
It was not easy to steer by, because the lurching
boat was short and the card span in erratic jerks
when she began to yaw about, swerving off her course
as she rose with the seas.
</p>
<p>The night got very dark, for the land-breeze brought
off a haze, but the engine lamp and glow from the
furnace door threw an elusive glimmer about the craft.
White sea-crests chased and caught her up, and rolling
forward broke between the funnel and the bows.
Water splashed on board, the engine hissed as the spray
fell on it, and the floorings got wet. One could see
the foam on deck wash about the headledge forward
as the bows went up with a sluggishness that was the
consequence of carrying an extra load of coal.
</p>
<p>The fireman could not steer by compass, and after
a time Jake took the helm from his tired companion.
Dick lay down under the side deck, from which
showers of brine poured close beside his head, but did
not go to sleep. He was thinking of Clare and what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
he must do when he met her father. It was important
that they should catch Kenwardine&#8217;s boat, since
he must not be allowed to land and finish his business
before they arrived. In the meanwhile, he listened
to the measured clank of the engine, which quickened
when the top blade of the screw swung out. So long
as she did not lift the others she would travel well,
but by and by he heard a splash in the crank-pit and
called to the fireman, who started the pump.
</p>
<p>Day broke in a blaze of fiery splendor, and the dripping
launch dried. The coast was near, the sea got
smooth, and the tired men were glad of the heat of
the red sun. By and by the breeze died away, and
the long swell heaved in a glassy calm, glittering with
silver and vivid blue. When their clothes were dry
they loosed and spread the awning, and a pungent
smell of olive oil and coffee floated about the boat as
the fireman cooked breakfast. After they had eaten,
Dick moved a bag or two of coal to trim the craft and
sounded the tank, because a high-pressure engine uses
a large quantity of fresh water. Then he unrolled a
chart and measured the distance to their port while
Jake looked over his shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to be in time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The advertisement
merely stated that the boat would sail to-day,
but as she didn&#8217;t leave the last port until yesterday
and she&#8217;d have some cargo to ship, it&#8217;s unlikely that
she&#8217;ll clear before noon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It might have been safer to telegraph, booking
two berths. These little boats don&#8217;t often miss a
chance of picking up a few dollars, and the skipper
would have waited.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought about that; but the telegram would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
shown what we were after if Kenwardine has bribed
somebody in the office, which is possible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem convinced he has had an important part
in these attacks on merchant ships,&#8221; Jake said thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to doubt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The man&#8217;s by way of being a friend of mine and
took you into his house when you were in some danger
of bleeding to death. I&#8217;m not sure that he&#8217;s guilty,
and now I&#8217;ve come with you, am going to see he gets
fair play; but if you can prove your charge, you may
do what you like with him. I think we&#8217;ll let it go at
that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick nodded. &#8220;In the first place, we must make
our port, and it&#8217;s lucky we&#8217;ll have smooth water until
the sea breeze gets up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Telling the fireman he could go to sleep, he moved
about the engine with an oilcan and afterwards cleaned
the fire. Then he lay on the counter with his hand
on the helm while the launch sped across the glassy
sea, leaving a long wake astern. The high coast ahead
got clearer, but after a time dark-blue lines began to
streak the glistening water and puffs of wind fanned
the men&#8217;s faces. The puffs were gratefully fresh and
the heat felt intolerable when they passed, but by and
by they settled into a steady draught and the dark
lines joined, until the sea was all a glowing ultramarine.
Then small ripples splashed about the launch
and Dick glanced ahead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s steaming well,&#8221; he said as he listened to the
steady snort of the exhaust and humming of the
cranks. &#8220;It&#8217;s lucky, because there&#8217;s some weight in
the wind.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></p>
<p>Some hours later, when the sea was flecked with
white, they closed with a strip of gray-green forest that
seemed to run out into the water. The launch rolled
and lurched as the foam-tipped combers hove her up
and the awning flapped savagely in the whistling
breeze. Away on the horizon, there was a dingy trail
of smoke. Presently Jake stood up on deck, and
watched the masts that rose above the fringe of trees.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a black-top funnel like the Danish boat&#8217;s,
and a flag with red and white on it, but it&#8217;s hanging
limp. They don&#8217;t feel the breeze inside.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He jumped down as Dick changed his course, and
they passed a spit of surf-washed sand, rounded the
last clump of trees, and opened up the harbor mouth.
The sunshine fell upon a glaring white and yellow
town, and oily water glittered between the wharf and
the dark hulls of anchored vessels, but Dick suddenly
set his lips. He knew the Danish boat, and she was
not there.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s gone,&#8221; said Jake with a hint of relief in his
voice. &#8220;That was her smoke on the skyline.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>ROUGH WATER</h3>
</div>

<p>As soon as they entered port, Dick and Jake went
to the office of a Spanish shipbroker, who offered
them his polite sympathy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We had very little cargo here, and when he heard
there was some dyewood at San Ignacio the captain
steamed off again,&#8221; he explained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of a port is San Ignacio, and how far
is it?&#8221; Dick asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an <i>aldea</i> on the shore of a lagoon, with a
wharf that small boats can reach, about forty miles
from here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then they take the dyewood off in boats? If
there is much of the stuff, it would be a long job.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is so, señor. The boats can only reach the
wharf when the tide is high. At other times, the
cargo must be carried down through the mud.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you a large chart of this coast?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The broker brought a chart and Dick studied it for
some minutes, making notes in his pocket-book. Then
he looked up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where can I get fresh water?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The broker asked how much he wanted and after
taking some paper money gave him a ticket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a pipe on the wharf and when the peon
sees the receipt he will fill your tanks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick thanked him and going out with Jake found
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
their fireman asleep in a wine-shop. They had some
trouble in wakening the man and after sending him
off to get the water, ordered some wine. The room
was dirty and filled with flies, but the lattice shutters
kept out the heat and they found the shadow pleasant
after the glare outside. Jake dropped into a cane
chair with a sigh of content. He felt cramped and
stiff after the long journey in the narrow cockpit of
the plunging launch, and was sensible of an enjoyable
lassitude. It would be delightful to lounge about in
the shade after refreshing himself with two or three
cool drinks, but he had misgivings that this was not
what Dick meant to do. When he had drained a large
glass of light, sweet wine, he felt peacefully at ease,
and resting his head on the chair-back closed his eyes.
After this he was conscious of nothing until Dick said:
&#8220;It&#8217;s not worth while to go to sleep.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not worth while?&#8221; Jake grumbled drowsily. &#8220;I
was awake all last night. It&#8217;s quiet and cool here and
I can&#8217;t stand for being broiled outside.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll have to. We start as soon as
Maccario has filled the tank.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake roused himself with a jerk. Dick leaned forward
wearily with his elbow on the table, but he looked
resolute.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you haven&#8217;t let up yet? You&#8217;re going on
to the lagoon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;The Danish boat has an
hour&#8217;s start, but she only steams eight or nine knots
and it will take some time to load her cargo.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we can&#8217;t drive the launch hard. The breeze
is knocking up the sea.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try,&#8221; Dick answered, and Jake growled in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
protest. His dream of rest and sleep, and perhaps
some mildly exciting adventure when the citizens came
out in the cool of the evening, had been rudely banished.
Moreover, he had had another reason for being
philosophical when he thought his comrade baulked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fool trick. She won&#8217;t make it if the sea
gets bad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick smiled dryly. &#8220;We can turn back if we find
her getting swamped. It looks as if you were not
very anxious to overtake Kenwardine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not,&#8221; Jake admitted. &#8220;If you&#8217;re determined
to go, I&#8217;m coming, but I&#8217;d be glad of a good excuse
for letting the matter drop.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somewhat to his surprise, Dick gave him a sympathetic
nod. &#8220;I know; I&#8217;ve felt like that, but the
thing can&#8217;t be dropped. It&#8217;s a hateful job, but it must
be finished now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; Jake answered, getting up. &#8220;If we
must go, the sooner we start the better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The launch looked very small and dirty when they
looked down on her from the wharf, and Jake noted
how the surf broke upon the end of the sheltering
point. Its deep throbbing roar warned him what they
might expect when they reached open water, but he
went down the steps and helped Dick to tighten some
bearing brasses, after which a peon threw down their
ropes and the screw began to rattle. With a few
puffs of steam from her funnel the launch moved
away and presently met the broken swell at the harbor
mouth. Then her easy motion changed to a
drunken lurch and Jake gazed with misgivings at the
white-topped seas ahead.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span></p>
<p>She went through the first comber&#8217;s crest with her
forefoot in the air and the foam washing deep along
the tilted deck, while the counter vanished in a white
upheaval. Then it swung up in turn, and frames and
planking shook as the engine ran away. This happened
at short intervals as she fought her way to
windward in erratic jerks, while showers of spray and
cinders blew aft into the face of her crew.
</p>
<p>Dick drove her out until the sea got longer and
more regular, when he turned and followed the coast,
but the flashing blue and white rollers were now on
her beam and flung her to lee as they passed. Sometimes
one washed across her low counter, and sometimes
her forward half was buried in a tumultuous
rush of foam. The pump was soon started and they
kept it going, but the water gathered in the crank-pit,
where it was churned into lather, and Jake and Maccario
relieved each other at helping the pump with
a bucket. They were drenched and half blinded by
the spray, but it was obvious that their labor was
needed and they persevered.
</p>
<p>Stopping for breath now and then, with his back
to the wind, Jake glanced at the coast as the boat
swung up with a sea. It made a hazy blur against
the brilliant sky, but his eyes were smarting and dazzled.
There was a confusing glitter all around him,
and even the blue hollows they plunged into were
filled with a luminous glow. Still he thought they
made progress, though the launch was drifting to leeward
fast, and he told Dick, who headed her out a
point or two.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not the usual sea breeze; it&#8217;s blowing really
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
fresh,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Do you think it will drop at sundown?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure,&#8221; Dick replied, shading his eyes as he
glanced at the windward horizon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then suppose it doesn&#8217;t drop?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If the sea gets dangerous, we&#8217;ll put the helm up
and run for shelter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you expect to find it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Dick admitted. &#8220;There are reefs
and shoals along the coast that we might get in behind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake laughed. &#8220;Well, I guess this is a pretty rash
adventure. You won&#8217;t turn back while you can see,
and there are safer things than running for a shoal
you don&#8217;t know, in the dark. However, there&#8217;s a
point one might get a bearing from abeam and I&#8217;ll try
to fix our position. It might be useful later.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stooping beside the compass, he gazed at the hazy
land across its card, and then crept under the narrow
foredeck with a chart. He felt the bows sweep upwards,
pause for a moment, and suddenly lurch down,
but now the sea was long and regular, the motion
was rhythmic. Besides, the thud and gurgle of water
outside the boat&#8217;s thin planks were soothing and harmonized
with the measured beat of the screw. Jake
got drowsy and although he had meant to take another
bearing when he thought he could double the
angle, presently fell asleep.
</p>
<p>It was getting dark when he awoke and crept into
the cockpit. There was a change in the motion, for
the launch did not roll so much and the combers no
longer broke in showers of spray against her side.
She swung up with a swift but easy lift, the foam
boiling high about her rail, and then gently slid down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
into the trough. It was plain that she was running
before the wind, but Jake felt that he must pull himself
together when he looked aft, for there is something
strangely daunting in a big following sea. A
high, white-topped ridge rolled up behind the craft,
roaring as it chased her, while a stream of spray blew
from its curling crest. It hid the rollers that came
behind; there was nothing to be seen but a hill of
water, and Jake found it a relief to fix his eyes ahead.
The backs of the seas were smoother and less disturbing
to watch as they faded into the gathering
dark. When the comber passed, he turned to Dick,
who stood, alert and highly strung, at the helm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re heading for the land,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What
are you steering by?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I got the bearing of a point I thought I recognized
on the chart before I lost sight of the coast. There&#8217;s
a long reef outshore of it, with a break near the point.
If we can get through, we might find shelter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose there&#8217;s something wrong with your bearing,
or you can&#8217;t make good your course?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;ll be trouble,&#8221; Dick answered grimly.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have the reef to lee and she won&#8217;t steam out
again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake put a kettle on the cylinder-top and took some
provisions from a locker. He was hungry and
thought he might need all the strength he had, while
he did not want to look at the sea. The pump was
clanking hard, but he could hear the water wash about
under the floorings, and the launch was very wet.
Darkness fell as he prepared a meal with the fireman&#8217;s
help, and they ate by the dim light of the engine-lamp,
while Dick, to whom they handed portions, crouched
at the helm, gazing close into the illuminated compass.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
Sometimes he missed the food they held out
and it dropped and was washed into the pump-well,
but he ate what he could without moving his eyes.
</p>
<p>Since he must find the opening in the reef, much
depended on his steering an accurate course, but this
was difficult, because he had to bear away before the
largest combers. Moreover, the erratic motion of a
short boat in broken water keeps the compass-card
rocking to and fro, and long practise is needed to hit
the mean of its oscillations. As a matter of fact, Dick
knew he was leaving much to luck.
</p>
<p>After a time, they heard a hoarse roar. Since the
sound would not carry far to windward, they knew the
reef was close ahead, but where the opening lay was
another matter. Dick had no guide except the compass,
and as the launch would probably swamp if he
tried to bring her round head to sea, he must run on
and take the risk. By and by, Jake, straining his eyes
to pierce the gloom, called out as he saw a ghostly
white glimmer to starboard. This was the surf spouting
on the reef and if it marked the edge of the channel,
they would be safe in going to port; if not, the
launch would very shortly be hurled upon the barrier.
</p>
<p>Dick stood up and gazed ahead. The white patch
was getting plainer, but he could see nothing else.
There was, however, a difference in the motion, and
the sea was confused. He ordered the engine to be
slowed, and they ran on until the belt of foam bore
abeam. They must be almost upon the reef now, or
else in the channel, and for the next minute or two
nobody spoke. If they had missed the gap, the first
warning would be a shock, and then the combers that
rolled up behind them would destroy the stranded
craft.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></p>
<p>She did not strike; the surf was level with her quarter,
and Jake, thrusting down a long boathook, found
no bottom. In another minute or two the water suddenly
got smooth, and he threw down the boathook.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re through,&#8221; he said in a strained voice.
&#8220;The reef&#8217;s astern.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Try the hand-lead,&#8221; Dick ordered him, as he
changed his course, since he was apparently heading
for the beach.
</p>
<p>Jake got four fathoms and soon afterwards eighteen
feet, when Dick stopped the engine and the launch
rolled upon the broken swell. A dark streak that
looked like forest indicated the land, and a line of foam
that glimmered with phosphorescent light ran outshore
of them. Now they were to lee of the reef,
the hoarse clamor of the surf rang about the boat.
Unfolding the chart, they studied it by the engine-lamp.
It was on too small a scale to give many details,
but they saw that the reef ran roughly level with
the coast and ended in a nest of shoals near a point.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We could ride out a gale here,&#8221; Jake remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We could, if we wanted,&#8221; Dick replied.
</p>
<p>Jake looked at him rather hard and then made a
sign of resignation. &#8220;Well, I guess I&#8217;ve had enough,
but if you&#8217;re going on&mdash;&mdash; How do you reckon
you&#8217;ll get through the shoals ahead?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I imagine some of them are mangrove islands, and
if so, there&#8217;ll be a channel of a sort between them. In
fact, the chart the broker showed me indicated something
of the kind. With good luck we may find it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Jake. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad to think it will
be a soft bottom if we run aground.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They went on, keeping, so far as they could judge,
midway between reef and beach, but after a time the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
lead showed shoaling water and Jake used the boathook
instead. Then the sky cleared and a half-moon
came out, and they saw haze and the loom of trees
outshore of them. Slowing the engine, they moved
on cautiously while the water gradually got shallower,
until glistening banks of mud began to break the surface.
Then they stopped the engine, but found the
launch still moved forward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I imagine it&#8217;s about four hours&#8217; flood,&#8221; Dick remarked.
&#8220;That means the water will rise for some
time yet, and although the current&#8217;s with us now I
think we can&#8217;t be far off the meeting of the tides.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake nodded. In places of the kind, the stream
often runs in from both ends until it joins and flows
in one direction from the shoalest spot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we ought to find a channel leading out on
the other side.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They let the engine run for a few minutes until the
boat touched bottom and stuck fast in the mud. The
wind seemed to be falling and the roar of the surf
had got fainter. Thin haze dimmed the moonlight
and there were strange splashings in the water that
gently lapped about the belts of mud. The stream
stopped running, but seeing no passage they waited
and smoked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can get out on the other side, we oughtn&#8217;t
to be very far from the lagoon,&#8221; Jake suggested.
</p>
<p>Presently there was a faint rippling against the
bows and the launch began to swing round.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The tide&#8217;s coming through from the other end,&#8221;
said Dick. &#8220;We may find a channel if we can push
her across the mud.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For half an hour they laboriously poled her with a
long oar and the boathook between the banks of mire.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
Sometimes she touched and stuck until the rising water
floated her off, and sometimes she scraped along the
bottom, but still made progress. They were breathless
and soaked with perspiration, while the foul scum
that ran off the oar stained their damp clothes. Then
Jake&#8217;s boathook sank a foot or two deeper and finding
the depth as good after a few vigorous pushes,
they started the engine.
</p>
<p>Sour exhalations rose from the wake of the churning
screw and there was a curious dragging feel in
the boat&#8217;s motion, as if she were pulling a body of
water after her, but this was less marked when Jake
found three or four feet, and by and by he threw
down the pole and they went half-speed ahead. After
a time, the mangroves outshore got farther off, the air
smelt fresher, and small ripples broke the surface of
the widening channel. They went full-speed, the
trees faded, and a swell that set her rocking met the
boat, although there still seemed to be a barrier of
sand or mud between her and open sea.
</p>
<p>Giving Jake the helm, Dick crawled under the foredeck,
where the floorings were drier than anywhere
else, and lay smoking and thinking until day broke.
The light, which grew brighter rapidly, showed a glistening
line of surf to seaward and mangrove forest on
a point ahead. Beyond this there seemed to be an
inlet, and then the shore curved out again. As they
passed the point Dick stood up on deck and presently
saw two tall spars rise above the mist. A few minutes
later, the top of a funnel appeared, and then a sharp
metallic rattle rang through the haze.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in the lagoon,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s the Danish
boat and she hasn&#8217;t finished heaving cargo on
board.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>KENWARDINE TAKES A RISK</h3>
</div>

<p>Shortly after the launch entered the lagoon,
the Danish boat hove her anchor and steamed
out to sea. Dick, who had engaged a half-breed pilot
to take the launch home, lounged in a canvas chair
under the poop awning. His eyes were half closed,
for the white boats and deckhouses flashed dazzlingly
in the strong light as the steamer lurched across the
vivid swell of the Caribbean. The cigarette he languidly
held had gone out, and his pose was slack.
</p>
<p>He was physically tired and his brain was dull, but
he was conscious of lethargic satisfaction. For a long
time he had been torn between his love for Clare and
his duty to his country. His difficulties were further
complicated by doubts of Kenwardine&#8217;s guilt, but recent
events had cleared these up. It was, on the
whole, a relief to feel that he must now go forward
and there need be no more hesitation and balancing
of probabilities. The time for that had gone and his
course was plain. He must confront Kenwardine
with a concise statement of his share in the plot and
force from him an undertaking that he would abandon
his traitorous work.
</p>
<p>This might be difficult, but Dick did not think he
would fail. Don Sebastian, who perhaps knew more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
than he did, was to meet him at a Cuban port, and the
Spaniard could be trusted to handle the matter with
skill. There was no direct communication between
Santa Brigida and Kingston, but steamers touched at
the latter place when making a round of other ports,
which would enable Dick and his ally to join Kenwardine&#8217;s
boat at her last call. If either of them had
gone on board at Santa Brigida, Kenwardine would
have left the ship at the next port.
</p>
<p>Since he had sailed on an English steamer, bound
for British territory, he would be subject to British
law when they met, and they could, if needful, have
him arrested. Dick admitted that this ought to be
done to begin with, but had not decided about it yet.
He would wait and be guided by events. The British
officials might doubt his story and decline to interfere,
but Kenwardine could not count on that, because Don
Sebastian was armed with credentials from the President
of a friendly state.
</p>
<p>Dick, however, dismissed the matter. He was tired
in mind and body, and did not mean to think of anything
important until he met Kenwardine. By and
by his head grew heavy, and resting it on the back
of his chair, he closed his eyes. When Jake came up,
followed by a steward carrying two tall glasses of
frothing liquor, he saw that his comrade was fast
asleep.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can put them down,&#8221; he told the steward.
&#8220;I&#8217;m thirsty enough to empty both, but you can bring
some more along when my partner wakes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After this he took a black seaman, who was making
some noise as he swept the poop, by the arm and firmly
led him to the other side of the deck. Then he drained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
the glasses with a sigh of satisfaction, and lighting
a cigarette, sat down near Dick&#8217;s feet. He did not
mean to sleep, but when he got up with a jerk as the
lunch bell rang he saw Dick smiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I been sitting there all this time?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;You were lying flat on deck
when I woke up an hour ago.&#8221; Then he indicated the
two glasses, which had rolled into the scupper channel.
&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised if those accounted for
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps they did,&#8221; Jake owned, grinning. &#8220;Anyhow,
we&#8217;ll have some more, with a lump of ice in it,
before we go down to lunch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Danish boat met fine weather as she leisurely
made her way across the Caribbean, and after an uneventful
voyage, Dick and Jake landed at a port in
Cuba. The British steamer from Santa Brigida had
not arrived, but the agent expected her in the evening,
and they found Don Sebastian waiting them at a hotel
he had named. When it was getting dark they walked
to the end of the harbor mole and sat down to watch
for the vessel.
</p>
<p>Rows of the lights began to twinkle, one behind the
other, at the head of the bay, and music drifted across
the water. A bright glow marked the plaza, where
a band was playing, but the harbor was dark except
for the glimmer of anchor-lights on the oily swell.
The occasional rattle of a winch, jarring harshly on
the music, told that the Danish boat was working
cargo. A faint, warm breeze blew off the land, and
there was a flicker of green and blue phosphorescence
as the sea washed about the end of the mole.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder how you&#8217;ll feel if Kenwardine doesn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
come,&#8221; Jake said presently, looking at Dick, who did
not answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He will come,&#8221; Don Sebastian rejoined with quiet
confidence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess he must know he&#8217;s doing a dangerous
thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Señor Kenwardine does know, but he plays for
high stakes and takes the risks of the game. If it
had not been necessary, he would not have ventured
on British soil, but since he was forced to go, he
thought the boldest plan the safest. This is what one
would expect, because the man is brave. He could
not tell how far my suspicions went and how much
Señor Brandon knew, but saw that he was watched
and if he tried to hide his movements he would betray
himself. It was wiser to act as if he had nothing
to fear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As he was forced to go, his business must be important,&#8221;
Dick said thoughtfully. &#8220;This means he
must be dealt with before he lands at Kingston. If
we allowed him to meet his confederates there, the
mischief would be done, and it might be too late afterwards
to stop them carrying out their plans.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Don Sebastian gave him a quiet smile. &#8220;One
might learn who his confederates are if he met them.
It looks as if you would sooner deal with our friend
on board.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would,&#8221; Dick said steadily. &#8220;His plotting must
be stopped, but I&#8217;m inclined to think I&#8217;d be content with
that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221; the Spaniard asked, turning to Jake.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that Kenwardine is in the worst of
the plot. He was a friend of mine and it&#8217;s your business
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
to prove him guilty. I mean to reserve my opinion
until you make your charges good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Don Sebastian. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be
guided by what happens when we see him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They let the matter drop, and half an hour later
a white light and a green light crept out of the dark
to seawards, and a faint throbbing grew into the measured
beat of a steamer&#8217;s screw. Then a low, shadowy
hull, outlined by a glimmer of phosphorescence, came
on towards the harbor mouth, and a rocket swept up
in a fiery curve and burst, dropping colored lights. A
harsh rattle of running chain broke out, the screw
splashed noisily for a few moments and stopped, and
a launch came swiftly down the harbor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The port doctor!&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;There&#8217;s some
cargo ready, and she won&#8217;t sail for three or four hours.
We had better wait until near the last moment before
we go on board. If our man saw us, he&#8217;d take alarm
and land.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Don Sebastian agreed, and they went back to the
hotel, and stayed there until word was sent that the
last boat was ready to leave the mole. They took
their places with one or two more passengers, and as
they drew near the steamer Dick looked carefully
about. Several shore boats were hanging on to the
warp alongside and a cargo barge lay beside her quarter.
It was obvious that she would not sail immediately,
and if Kenwardine saw them come on board,
he would have no trouble in leaving the vessel. If
he landed, he would be in neutral territory, and their
hold on him would be gone. To make things worse,
a big electric lamp had been hung over the gangway
so as to light the ladder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></p>
<p>Dick could not see Kenwardine among the passengers
on deck, and getting on board as quietly as
possible, they went down the nearest companion stairs
and along an alleyway to the purser&#8217;s office. A number
of rooms opened on to the passage, and Dick had
an uncomfortable feeling that chance might bring him
face to face with Kenwardine. Nobody met them,
however, and they found the purser disengaged.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have a passenger list handy, you might
let me see it,&#8221; Dick said as he took the tickets.
</p>
<p>The purser gave him a list, and he noted Kenwardine&#8217;s
name near the bottom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We may as well be comfortable, although we&#8217;re
not going far,&#8221; he resumed. &#8220;What berths have you
left?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can pick your place,&#8221; said the purser. &#8220;We
haven&#8217;t many passengers this trip, and there&#8217;s nobody
on the starboard alleyway. However, if you want a
hot bath in the morning, you had better sleep to port.
They&#8217;ve broken a pipe on the other side.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A bath is a luxury in the Caribbean, but white men
who have lived any time in the tropics prefer it warm,
and Dick saw why the passengers had chosen the port
alleyway. He decided to take the other, since Kenwardine
would then be on the opposite side of the ship.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have the starboard rooms,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One
can go without a bath for once, and you&#8217;ll no doubt
reach Kingston to-morrow night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect so,&#8221; agreed the purser. &#8220;Still, we
mayn&#8217;t be allowed to steam in until the next morning.
They&#8217;re taking rather troublesome precautions in the
British ports since the commerce-raider got to work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick signed to the others and crossed the after well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
towards the poop in a curiously grim mood. He hated
the subterfuge he had practised, and there was something
very repugnant in this stealthy tracking down
of his man, but the chase was nearly over and he
meant to finish it. Defenseless merchant seamen
could not be allowed to suffer for his squeamishness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don Sebastian and I will wait in the second-class
smoking-room until she starts,&#8221; he said to Jake. &#8220;I
want you to lounge about the poop deck and watch
the gangway. Let us know at once if you see Kenwardine
and it looks as if he means to go ashore.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He disappeared with his companion, and Jake went
up a ladder and sat down on the poop, where he was
some distance from the saloon passengers. Kenwardine
was less likely to be alarmed at seeing him, but
he did not like his part. The man had welcomed
him to his house, and although he had lost some money
there, Jake did not believe his host had meant to plunder
him. After all, Dick and Don Sebastian might
be mistaken, and he felt mean as he watched the gangway.
A hint from him would enable Kenwardine to
escape, and it was galling to feel that it must not be
given. Indeed, as time went on, Jake began to wish
that Kenwardine would learn that they were on board
and take alarm. He was not sure he would warn
Dick if the fellow tried to steal away.
</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the pumps on board a water-boat
had stopped clanking and she was towed towards the
harbor. The steamer&#8217;s winches rattled as they hove
up cargo from the barge, but Jake had seen that there
was not much left and she would sail as soon as the
last load was hoisted in. Lighting a cigarette, he ran
his eye along the saloon-deck. A few passengers in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
white clothes walked up and down, and he studied
their faces as they passed the lights, but Kenwardine
was not among them. A group leaned upon the rails
in the shadow of a boat, and Jake felt angry because
he could not see them well. The suspense was getting
keen, and he wished Kenwardine would steal
down the ladder and jump into a boat before he could
give the alarm.
</p>
<p>There was, however, no suspicious movement on the
saloon-deck, and Jake, walking to the rail, saw the
peons putting the last of the barge&#8217;s cargo into the
sling. It came up with a rattle of chain, and the
barge sheered off. Somebody gave an order, and
there was a bustle on deck. In another few minutes
Kenwardine&#8217;s last chance of escape would be gone,
because a British ship is British territory, and her
captain can enforce his country&#8217;s laws.
</p>
<p>Jake threw away his cigarette and took out another
when the whistle blew and the windlass began to clank.
Although the anchor was coming up, two boats hung
on to the foot of the ladder, and he could not be expected
to see what was going on while he lighted his
cigarette. Kenwardine was clever, and might have
waited until the last moment before making his escape,
with the object of leaving his pursuers on board, but
if he did not go now it would be too late. The clank
of the windlass stopped, and Jake, dropping the match
when the flame touched his fingers, looked up. A
group of dark figures were busy on the forecastle, and
he saw the captain on the bridge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All clear forward, sir!&#8221; a hoarse voice cried, and
somebody shouted: &#8220;Cast off the boats!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then there was a rattle of blocks as the ladder was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
hoisted in, and the deck quivered as the engines began
to throb. Jake heard the screw slowly flounder round
and the wash beneath the poop as the steamer moved
out to sea, but there was nobody except their colored
crews on board the boats that dropped astern. Kenwardine
had had his chance and lost it. He had been
too bold and now must confront his enemies.
</p>
<p>Jake went down the ladder and found Dick waiting
at the door of the second-class saloon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s on board,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry he is. In
fact, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d have told you if he&#8217;d tried to
light out at the last moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick gave him a dry smile. &#8220;I suspect that Don
Sebastian didn&#8217;t trust you altogether. He left me,
and I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised to learn that he had found
a place where he could watch the gangway without
being seen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the Spaniard crossed the after
well. &#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we must decide when we
ought to have our interview with Señor Kenwardine,
and I think we should put it off until just before we
land.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Jake asked. &#8220;It would be much pleasanter
to get it over and have done with it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; Don Sebastian answered quietly.
&#8220;We do not know how Señor Kenwardine will meet
the situation. He is a bold man, and it is possible
that he will defy us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How can he defy you when he knows you can
hand him over to the British authorities?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That might be necessary; but I am not sure it is
the British authorities he fears the most.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then who is he afraid of?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span></p>
<p>&#8220;His employers, I imagine,&#8221; Don Sebastian answered
with a curious smile. &#8220;It is understood that
they trust nobody and are not very gentle to those
who do not serve them well. Señor Kenwardine
knows enough about their plans to be dangerous, and
it looks as if he might fail to carry their orders out.
If we give him too long a warning, he may escape us
after all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how he could escape. You have him
corralled when he&#8217;s under the British flag.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Don Sebastian shrugged as he indicated the
steamer&#8217;s low iron rail and the glimmer of foam in
the dark below.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is one way! If he takes it, we shall learn
no more than we know now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He left them, and Jake looked at Dick. &#8220;It&#8217;s unthinkable!
I can&#8217;t stand for it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Dick very quietly; &#8220;he mustn&#8217;t be
pushed too far. For all that, his friends can&#8217;t be allowed
to go on sinking British ships.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>THE LAST ENCOUNTER</h3>
</div>

<p>Dick awoke next morning with a feeling of
nervous strain that got worse as the day wore
on. By going down to the saloon immediately the
breakfast-bell rang and making a hurried meal, he
and his companions avoided meeting Kenwardine, and,
after bribing a steward, were given lunch with the
second-class passengers. Two difficulties were thus
got over, but the time passed heavily while they kept
out of sight in quiet corners of the after well, and
Dick found it a relief when a friendly engineer invited
him below. Here he spent some hours, smoking and
watching the machinery, while the fingers of the clock
on the bulkhead crawled with painful slowness round
the dial.
</p>
<p>When he went up on deck the bold ridge of the
Blue Mountains rose above the dazzling sea, but the
lower slopes were veiled in haze and he could not tell
how far the land was off. A mate informed him that
they would have the coast close aboard at dusk, but
did not think anybody would be allowed to land until
the morning. Struck by a thought, Dick asked if any
passenger boats were likely to be in port, and the mate
replied that a Spanish liner would leave for Brazil
soon after they arrived, but he knew of no vessel
going north for the next few days. Then, after giving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
Dick some advice about the choice of a hotel, he
went away.
</p>
<p>Towards sunset the sea-breeze dropped and the mist
gathered thicker about the hills. Faint puffs of hot
wind began to blow off the land, which faded suddenly
as darkness rolled down. A thin haze drifted out
across the water and the speed slackened as the vessel
closed with the shore. Then dim lights blinked
out ahead, the engines stopped, and a detonating rocket
burst high up in the sky. Soon afterwards a steam
launch came off, and the purser stopped near Dick
on his way to his room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going in, but will have to wait until the
agent gets formal permission from the guardship&#8217;s
commander, who must see our papers first,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;As this may take some time, perhaps you had better
dine on board.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When the bell rang Dick and his companions went
to the saloon. There were not many passengers, and
the room was nearly empty, but as they entered Dick
saw Kenwardine at the bottom of a table. He glanced
up as he heard their footsteps, and with an abrupt
movement turned his revolving chair partly round.
Next moment, however, he looked at Dick coolly, and
after a nod of recognition went on with his dinner.
Don Sebastian indicated a table between Kenwardine
and the door, and they sat down.
</p>
<p>Jake played with his food, and Dick had not much
appetite, although he partook of the dishes set before
him, because he wanted an excuse for occupying the
table until Kenwardine had finished. The latter
showed no anxiety to get away and now and then
kept the steward waiting while he studied the menu.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
Dick, who envied his coolness, thought it indicated
one of two things: Kenwardine knew he was beaten
and was philosophically resigned, or had some plan
by which he hoped to baffle his pursuers. Now and
then Dick looked at Don Sebastian inquiringly, but
the Spaniard answered with an enigmatic smile.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, the passengers went away to pack
or get ready for a run ashore, and at last the saloon
was empty except for Dick&#8217;s party and Kenwardine.
Then Don Sebastian crossed the floor and bowed to
the latter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be a favor if you will take a glass of
wine with us,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said Kenwardine, getting up, and Don
Sebastian, who gave an order to a steward, led the
way to a corner table where they would not be disturbed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were, perhaps, surprised to see us, señor,&#8221;
he resumed, when the others joined them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was,&#8221; Kenwardine admitted. &#8220;Still, I suppose
I ought to have been prepared for something of the
kind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Don Sebastian bowed. &#8220;One may understand that
as a compliment?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it is, in a sense. But I certainly did not
expect to meet Mr. Fuller. We are told that his people
mean to preserve a strict neutrality.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake colored. &#8220;I&#8217;d have stood out if you had kept
your dago friends off my partner. That&#8217;s what
brought me in; but I&#8217;m still trying to be as neutral
as I can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Señor Fuller has informed us that he means to
see you get fair play,&#8221; Don Sebastian interposed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he has my thanks for that, and my sympathy,
which I think he needs,&#8221; Kenwardine rejoined
with a twinkle. &#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt that he owes Mr.
Brandon something, and I flatter myself that he rather
liked me. It must have been embarrassing to find
that he couldn&#8217;t be friends with both. However, you
had better tell me what you want. My clothes are
not packed, and I must land as soon as possible, because
I have some business to transact to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid you will be unable to do so,&#8221; Don
Sebastian said politely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The explanation is rather long, but, to begin with,
you no doubt know I was ordered to watch you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must admit that I suspected something very like
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The President imagined you might become dangerous
to the neutrality of the State, and I learned
enough to show that he was right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you learn?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Don Sebastian smiled. &#8220;I will be frank and put
down my cards. I would not do so, señor, if I thought
you could beat them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He began a concise account of the discoveries he
had made; showing Kenwardine&#8217;s association with the
German, Richter, and giving particulars about the
purchase of the Adexe coaling wharf. Jake leaned
forward with his elbows on the table, listening eagerly,
while Dick sat motionless. Part of what he heard
was new to him, but the Spaniard&#8217;s statements could
not be doubted, and he envied Kenwardine&#8217;s nerve.
The latter&#8217;s face was, for the most part, inscrutable,
but now and then he made a sign of languid agreement,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
as if to admit that his antagonist had scored a
point.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said when the other finished, &#8220;it is a
story that might do me harm, and there are parts I
cannot deny; but it is not complete. One finds awkward
breaks in it. For example, you do not show
how the raider got coal and information from the
Adexe Company.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Señor Brandon can do so,&#8221; said Don Sebastian,
who turned to Dick.
</p>
<p>Taking his cue from the Spaniard, Dick related
what he had noted at the coaling wharf and learned
about the movements of the tug when the auxiliary
cruiser was in the neighborhood. His account to some
extent filled the gaps that Don Sebastian&#8217;s narrative
had left, but now he came to put the different points
together and consider them as a whole, their significance
seemed less. He began to see how a hostile
critic would look at the thing. Much of his evidence
was based upon conjecture that might be denied. Yet,
while it was not convincing, it carried weight.
</p>
<p>There was a pause when he finished, and Jake was
conscious of a strong revulsion of feeling as he studied
his companions. In a way, the thin, dark-faced Spaniard
and tranquil Englishman were alike. Both wore
the stamp of breeding and were generally marked by
an easy good humor and polished wit that won men&#8217;s
confidence and made them pleasant companions. But
this was on the surface; beneath lay a character as
hard and cold as a diamond. They were cunning,
unscrupulous intriguers, who would stick at nothing
that promised to serve their ends. Jake knew Kenwardine
now, and felt angry as he remembered the infatuation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
that had prevented his understanding the
man.
</p>
<p>Then he glanced at Dick, who sat waiting with a
quietly resolute look. Dick was different from the
others; he rang true. One could not doubt his rather
naïve honesty, but in spite of this there was something
about him that made him a match for his scheming
opponent. Kenwardine, of course, had courage, but
Dick was armed with a stern tenacity that made him
careless of the hurt he received. Now, though he had
nothing to gain and much to lose, he would hold on
because duty demanded it. The contrast between
them threw a lurid light upon Kenwardine&#8217;s treachery.
</p>
<p>Then the latter said: &#8220;You have stated things
clearly, Brandon, but, after all, what you offer is
rather plausible argument than proof. In fact, you
must see that your evidence isn&#8217;t strong enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s enough to justify our handing you to the military
officers in Kingston, who would, no doubt, detain
you while they made inquiries.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which you don&#8217;t want to do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Dick shortly. &#8220;But I may be forced.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. This brings us back to the point we
started from,&#8221; Kenwardine replied and turned to Don
Sebastian. &#8220;What is it you want?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To know where Richter is, and who supplied him
with the money he paid for the coaling business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m sorry I cannot tell you, and you certainly
wouldn&#8217;t get the information by having me
locked up, but perhaps I can meet you in another way.
Now it&#8217;s obvious that you know enough to make it
awkward for me to carry on the Adexe wharf, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
my help is necessary for the part of the business you
object to. If I retire from it altogether, you ought
to be satisfied.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Spaniard did not answer, and while he pondered,
the beat of a launch&#8217;s engine came in through
the open ports. Kenwardine lighted a cigarette,
spending some time over it, and as he finished the
launch ran alongside. There were footsteps on deck,
and a few moments later a steward entered the saloon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going in,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;Will you
have your luggage put on deck?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can take ours up,&#8221; said Don Sebastian, who
indicated Kenwardine. &#8220;Leave this gentleman&#8217;s for
the present.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kenwardine did not object, but Jake, who was
watching him, thought he saw, for the first time, a
hint of uneasiness in his look. Then Don Sebastian
got up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must think over Señor Kenwardine&#8217;s suggestion,
and you may want to talk to him,&#8221; he said, and went
out.
</p>
<p>When he had gone, Kenwardine turned to Dick.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a matter I would like to clear up; I had
nothing to do with the attempts that seem to have
been made upon your life. In fact, I suspected nothing
of the kind until you told me about the accident
at the dam, but Fuller afterwards showed me that it
was time to interfere.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; said Jake. &#8220;Anyhow, I gave him
a plain hint, but as he didn&#8217;t seem able to stop the
accidents, I put Don Sebastian on the track.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t with any fairness make me accountable
for the actions of half-breeds who hold life very cheap
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
and meant to keep a paying job,&#8221; Kenwardine resumed,
addressing Dick. &#8220;You knew what kind of
men you had to deal with and took the risk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to see how a white man could make use
of such poisonous colored trash,&#8221; Jake remarked.
&#8220;But I expect you don&#8217;t want me, and I&#8217;ll see what
Don Sebastian is doing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He left them, and there was silence for a few moments
until the screw began to throb and they heard
the wash of water along the steamer&#8217;s side. Then
Kenwardine said quietly, &#8220;Fuller has tact. There&#8217;s
a matter that concerns us both that has not been mentioned
yet. I&#8217;ll clear the ground by stating that although
our Spanish friend has not decided what he
means to do, I shall not go back to Santa Brigida. I
imagine this will remove an obstacle from your way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks for the lead,&#8221; Dick answered. &#8220;I resolved,
some time ago, to marry Clare if she would
have me, though I saw that it would mean separating
her from you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet you believed she stole your papers!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought she did,&#8221; Dick answered doggedly.
&#8220;Still, I didn&#8217;t blame her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You blamed me? But you ought to be satisfied,
in one respect, because Clare and I are separated, and
I&#8217;ll own that I&#8217;m anxious about her future. Had
things gone well, I would have tried to keep her away
from you; in fact, I did try, because I frankly think
she might have made a better marriage. For all that,
if you are determined and she is willing, you have my
consent. You will probably never be very rich, but I
could trust Clare to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am determined.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. I can tell you something you may
be glad to hear. Clare did not rob you, nor did I.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick looked at him with keen relief. &#8220;Then who
took the plans?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your cousin. The pocket they were in was unbuttoned
when he took hold of you and hurried you
out of the house. He brought them to me afterwards,
but I saw they were not valuable and destroyed them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was impossible to doubt the statement, and Dick
flushed with shame and anger as he realized that his
absurd and unjust suspicion of Clare had prevented
his seeing who the real culprit was. Clare had accidentally
torn his pocket loose, the bulky envelope must
have been sticking out, and Lance had noticed it as
he hustled him across the hall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; Lance took the plans!&#8221; he exclaimed
hoarsely. &#8220;But why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks as if you hadn&#8217;t heard from home.
Your cousin has stepped into your place. I imagine
he had always envied it, and didn&#8217;t hesitate when he
saw an opportunity of getting rid of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick was silent for a few moments and his face was
very hard. He heard the crew hurrying about the
deck, and a winch rattle as the hatches were lifted.
The vessel would soon be in port, and Kenwardine&#8217;s
fate must be decided before they went ashore; but the
man looked very cool as he leaned back in his chair,
languidly waiting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me this earlier?&#8221; Dick asked
sternly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should have thought my object was plain
enough,&#8221; Kenwardine replied. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want Clare
to marry a badly paid engineer. Things are different
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
now and I admit that you have stood a rather severe
test. I&#8217;ll give you two letters; one to Clare, advising
her to marry you, and the other stating how your
cousin stole the plans, which you can use in any way
you like. Before writing them, I&#8217;d like to see Fuller
for a minute or two. You needn&#8217;t hesitate about it,
because I don&#8217;t mean to victimize him in any way.
In fact, I want to tell him something to his advantage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick went out, and when he had sent Jake down,
leaned upon the steamer&#8217;s rail lost in thought. It had
been a shock to learn of his cousin&#8217;s treachery, but
this was balanced by the relief of knowing that Clare
was innocent. Indeed, he grew hot with shame as
he wondered how he had suspected her. He felt angry
with Kenwardine for keeping him in the dark so long,
but his indignation was tempered by a touch of grim
amusement. Since the fellow was ambitious for
Clare, he must have regretted having destroyed the
plans when he learned that Dick&#8217;s father was rich, but
after conniving at the theft he could not put matters
right. Now, when his career was ended, he was willing,
for his daughter&#8217;s sake, to clear Dick&#8217;s name and
help him to regain the station he had lost. But Dick
was not sure he wished to regain it just yet. He had
been turned out of the army; his father, who had
never shown much love for him, had been quick to
believe the worst; and he was bound for a time to a
man who had befriended him.
</p>
<p>Presently he looked about. Lights were opening
out in twinkling lines as the steamer moved shoreward,
and a splash of oars came out of the gloom.
Dick vacantly noted that several boats were approaching,
and then a winch rattled and Don Sebastian, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
had come up quietly, touched his arm. A chain sling
swung past beneath a moving derrick, and as they
crossed the deck to get out of the way he saw a steamer
close by. Her windlass was clanking as she shortened
her cable and he supposed she was the Spanish boat
the mate had spoken of, but he followed his companion
and listened to what he had to say. Then as
the anchor was let go he thought Jake ought to have
come back and went to look for him. He found the
lad leaning against the deckhouse, smoking a cigarette.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Kenwardine?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I left him in the saloon. He gave me two letters
for you and a useful hint about some debts of mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind that! How long is it since you left
him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite five minutes,&#8221; Jake answered coolly.
</p>
<p>Struck by something in his tone, Dick ran below
and found no luggage in Kenwardine&#8217;s room. None
of the stewards whom he asked had seen him for some
time, and a hasty search showed that he was not on
deck. Dick went back to Jake.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know where the fellow is?&#8221; he asked
sharply as Don Sebastian came up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you insist, I imagine he&#8217;s on board the Spanish
boat,&#8221; Jake answered with a chuckle. &#8220;As she seems
to have her anchor up, I guess it&#8217;s too late for us to
interfere.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A sharp rattle of chain that had rung across the
water suddenly stopped and Dick saw one of the
steamer&#8217;s colored side-lights slowly move. It was
plain that she was going to sea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Since we had been passed by the doctor, there was
nothing to prevent the shore boats coming alongside,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
and I believe one or two did so before we quite
stopped,&#8221; Jake resumed. &#8220;They were, no doubt,
looking for a job, and the ladder was already lowered.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you knew Kenwardine meant to steal
away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know, but thought it likely,&#8221; Jake replied
with some dryness. &#8220;On the whole, it was perhaps
the best thing he could do. What&#8217;s your opinion,
Don Sebastian?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Spaniard smiled. &#8220;I think the President will
be satisfied that it was the simplest way out of the difficulty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jake, &#8220;here are your letters, Dick.
Perhaps we had better see about getting ashore.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They moved towards the gangway, past the hatch
where some heavy cases were being hoisted up, and
Dick carefully put the letters in his pocket. This distracted
his attention from what was going on, and
when he heard a warning shout he stepped back a moment
too late. A big case swung forward beneath a
derrick-boom and struck his shoulder. Staggering
with the blow, he lost his balance and plunged down
the hatch. He was conscious of a heavy shock, a
sudden, stinging pain, and then remembered nothing
more.

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>RICHTER&#8217;S MESSAGE</h3>
</div>

<p>It was a hot evening and Clare sat at a table in the
patio, trying to read. The light was bad, for
buzzing insects hovered about the lamp, but the house
had not cooled down yet and she wanted to distract
her troubled thoughts. Footsteps and voices rose
from the street outside, where the citizens were passing
on their way to the plaza, but the sounds were faint
and muffled by the high walls. The house had been
built in times when women were jealously guarded
and a dwelling was something of a fort. Now, with
the iron gate in the narrow, arched entrance barred,
the girl was securely cut off from the exotic life of
the city.
</p>
<p>This isolation was sometimes a comfort, but it
sometimes jarred. Clare was young, and fond of
cheerful society, and the iron gate had its counterpart
in another barrier, invisible but strong, that shut
her out from much she would have enjoyed. She
often stood, so to speak, gazing wistfully between
the bars at innocent pleasures in which she could not
join. Kenwardine, in spite of his polished manners,
was tactfully avoided by English and Americans of
the better class, and their wives and daughters openly
showed their disapproval.
</p>
<p>At length Clare gave up the attempt to read. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
felt lonely and depressed. Nobody had been to the
house since Kenwardine left, and Dick and Jake were
away. She did not see Dick often and he was, of
course, nothing to her; for one thing, he was in some
mysterious way her father&#8217;s enemy. Still, she missed
him; he was honest, and perhaps, if things had been
different&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>Then she turned her head sharply as she heard the
click of a bolt. This was strange, because Lucille
had locked the gate. She could not see it in the gloom
of the arch, but it had certainly opened. Then as she
waited with somewhat excited curiosity a dark figure
appeared on the edge of the light, and she put down
her book as Richter came forward. He made very
little noise and stopped near the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you get in?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>Richter smiled. &#8220;You have forgotten that Herr
Kenwardine gave me a key.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know he had,&#8221; Clare answered. &#8220;But
won&#8217;t you sit down?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He moved a chair to a spot where his white clothes
were less conspicuous, though Clare noted that he did
so carelessly and not as if he wished to hide himself.
Then he put a small linen bag on the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is some money that belongs to Herr Kenwardine;
you may find it useful. It is not good to be
without money in a foreign town.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare looked at him with alarm. He was fat and
generally placid, but his philosophical good humor
was not so marked as usual.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you have heard from my father?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I have a cablegram. It was sent in a
roundabout way through other people&#8217;s hands and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
took some time to reach me. Herr Kenwardine left
Kingston last night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But there is no boat yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Richter nodded. &#8220;He is not coming to Santa
Brigida. I do not think that he will come back at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a moment or two Clare felt unnerved, but she
pulled herself together. She realized now that she
had long had a vague fear that something of this kind
would happen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then where has he gone? Why didn&#8217;t he write
to me?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has gone to Brazil and will, no doubt, write
when he arrives. In the meantime, you must wait and
tell people he is away on business. This is important.
You have some money, and the house is yours for a
month or two.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why has he gone? Will you show me the
cablegram?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You could not understand it, and it might be better
that you should not know,&#8221; Richter answered.
Then he paused and his manner, which had been
friendly and sympathetic, changed. His short hair
seemed to bristle and his eyes sparkled under his shaggy
brows as he resumed: &#8220;Herr Kenwardine was forced
to go at the moment he was needed most. Your
father, fräulein, is a bold and clever man, but he was
beaten by a blundering fool. We had confidence in
him, but the luck was with his enemies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are his enemies?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Englishman, Brandon, is the worst,&#8221; Richter
answered with keen bitterness. &#8220;We knew he was
against us, but thought this something of a joke.
Well, it seems we were mistaken. These English are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
obstinate; often without imagination or forethought,
they blunder on, and chance, that favors simpletons,
is sometimes with them. But remember, that if your
father meets with misfortunes, you have Brandon to
thank.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The color left Clare&#8217;s face, but she tried to brace
herself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What misfortunes has my father to fear?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Richter hesitated, and then said deprecatingly: &#8220;I
cannot be as frank as I wish. Herr Kenwardine&#8217;s
work was most important, but he failed in it. I know
this was not his fault and would trust him again, but
there are others, of higher rank, who may take a different
view. Besides, it will be remembered that he
is an Englishman. If he stays in Brazil, I think he
will be left alone, but he will get no money and some
he has earned will not be sent. Indeed, if it were
known, fräulein, I might be blamed for paying you
this small sum, but I expect you will need it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He got up, as if to go, but Clare stopped him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will come back as soon as you know something
more and tell me what to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Richter made an apologetic gesture. &#8220;That will
be impossible. I ran some risk in coming now and
leave Santa Brigida to-night in a fishing boat. You
will stay in this house, as if you expect your father
back, until you hear from him. He will send you instructions
when he lands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the kitchen door across the patio opened and
a bucket clinked. Richter stepped back into the
shadow and Clare looked round as an indistinct figure
crossed the tiles. When she looked back Richter had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
gone and she heard the splash of water. She sat still
until the servant went away and then sank down
limply in her chair. She was left alone and unprotected
except for old Lucille, in a foreign town where
morals were lax and license was the rule. The few
English and Americans whose help she might have
asked regarded her with suspicion, and it looked as
if her father would be unable to send for her.
</p>
<p>This was daunting but it was not the worst. Richter
had vaguely hinted at Kenwardine&#8217;s business, which
was obviously mysterious. She saw where his hints
led, but she would not follow up the clue. Her father
had been ruined by Brandon, and her heart was filled
with anger, in which she found it some relief to indulge.
Dick had long been their enemy and thought
her a thief, while the possibility that he was justified
in the line he had taken made matters worse. If she
was the daughter of a man dishonored by some treason
against his country, she could not marry Dick.
She had already refused to do so, but she did not
want to be logical. It was simpler to hate him as the
cause of her father&#8217;s downfall. The latter had always
indulged her, and now she understood that he
would land in Brazil penniless, or at least impoverished.
Since he was accustomed to extravagance, it
was painful to think of what he might suffer.
</p>
<p>Then she began to speculate about Richter&#8217;s visit.
He had come at some risk and seemed sorry for her,
but he had urged her to stay in the house, as if she
expected her father to return. This could be of no
advantage to the latter, and she wondered whether
the man had meant to make use of her to divert suspicion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
from himself and his friends. It seemed uncharitable
to think so, but she was very bitter and
could trust nobody.
</p>
<p>After a time she got calm, and remembering that
she had her own situation to consider, counted the
money in the bag. It was not a large sum, but with
economy might last for a few weeks, after which she
must make some plans. She was incapable of grappling
with any fresh difficulty yet, but she must brace
her courage and not break down, and getting up with
a resolute movement she went into the house.
</p>
<p>On the morning after his fall, Dick came to his
senses in a shaded room. He heard a shutter rattle
as the warm breeze flowed in, and noted a flickering
patch of light on the wall, but found with some annoyance
that he could not see it well. His head was
throbbing and a bandage covered part of his face.
His side was painful too, and he groaned when he
tried to move.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where am I?&#8221; he asked a strange man, who appeared
beside his bed, and added in an injured tone:
&#8220;It looks as if I&#8217;d got into trouble again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You had a narrow escape,&#8221; the other answered
soothingly. &#8220;You cut your head badly and broke
two of your ribs when you fell down the steamer&#8217;s
hold. Now you&#8217;re in hospital, but you&#8217;re not to talk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get worse if you keep me quiet,&#8221; Dick grumbled.
&#8220;How can you find out things that bother you,
unless you talk?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother about them,&#8221; said the doctor.
&#8220;Have a drink instead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick looked at the glass with dull suspicion. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know, though I&#8217;m thirsty. You see, I&#8217;ve been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
in a doctor&#8217;s hands before. In fact, I seem to have
a gift for getting hurt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s cool and tastes nice,&#8221; the other urged. &#8220;You
didn&#8217;t rest much last night and if you go to sleep now
we&#8217;ll try to satisfy your curiosity afterwards.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick hesitated, but took the glass and went to sleep
soon after he drained it. When he awoke the light
had vanished from the wall and the room was shadowy,
but he saw Jake sitting by the bed. A nurse, who
put a thermometer in his mouth and felt his pulse,
nodded to the lad as if satisfied before she went away.
Dick&#8217;s head was clearer, and although the movement
hurt him he resolutely fixed his uncovered eye on his
companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;don&#8217;t tell me not to talk. Do
you know why they&#8217;ve fixed this bandage so that it
half blinds me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake looked embarrassed. &#8220;There&#8217;s a pretty deep
cut on your forehead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you suppose I can&#8217;t feel it? But I want to
know why they&#8217;re not satisfied with tying my forehead
up? You may as well tell me, because I&#8217;m not
going to sleep again. It looks as if I&#8217;d slept all day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The cut runs through your eyelid and the doctor
thinks it wiser to be careful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;About my eye?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a precaution,&#8221; Jake declared. &#8220;There&#8217;s
really nothing the matter, but he thought it would be
better to keep out the strong light.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Dick, who was not deceived, and was
silent for the next few moments. Then he resumed
in a rather strained voice: &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s talk about
something else. Where&#8217;s Don Sebastian?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen him since lunch, but he spent the
morning interviewing the British authorities.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think he told them to send after Kenwardine?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jake with a twinkle, &#8220;I rather think
he&#8217;s put them off the track, and although he had to
give them a hint out of politeness, doesn&#8217;t want them
to know too much. Then there&#8217;s only an old-fashioned
cruiser here and I understand she has to stop
for a guardship. In fact, Don Sebastian seems to
imagine that Kenwardine is safe so long as he keeps
off British soil. However, an official gentleman with
a refined taste in clothes and charming manners called
at our hotel and is coming to see you as soon as the
doctor will let him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Next morning Dick saw the gentleman, who stated
his rank and then asked a number of questions, which
Dick did not answer clearly. He was glad that his
bandaged head gave him an excuse for seeming stupid.
He had done his part, and now Kenwardine could
do no further harm, it would be better for everybody
if he got away. After a time, his visitor observed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you seem to have rendered your country
a service, and I expect you will find things made
smooth for you at home after our report upon the matter
has been received.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;It looks as if you knew why
I left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The gentleman made a sign of assent. &#8220;Your
Spanish friend was discreet, but he told us something.
Besides, there are army lists and <i>London Gazettes</i> in
Kingston.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick was silent for a few moments, and then said:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
&#8220;As a matter of fact, I am not anxious to go home
just yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you not?&#8221; the other asked with a hint of
polite surprise. &#8220;I do not think there would be much
difficulty about a new commission, and officers are
wanted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not likely to want a man with one eye,
and I expect it will come to that,&#8221; Dick said grimly.
</p>
<p>His visitor was sympathetic, but left soon afterwards,
and Dick thought he was not much wiser about
Kenwardine&#8217;s escape than when he came. Two or
three weeks later he was allowed to get up, although
he was tightly strapped with bandages and made to
wear a shade over his eyes. When he lay in the open
air one morning, Jake joined him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must get back to Santa Brigida as soon as we
can,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;re planning an extension of the
irrigation scheme, and the old man and Ida are coming
out. The doctor seems to think you might go
by the next boat if we take care of you. But I&#8217;d better
give you Kenwardine&#8217;s letters. We took them
out of your pocket the night you got hurt, and I&#8217;ve
been wondering why you haven&#8217;t asked for them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; Dick answered dully. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
that I&#8217;ll use them now. I&#8217;ll be glad to get back and
dare say I can do my work with one eye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll soon have both,&#8221; Jake declared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s doubtful,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think the
doctor&#8217;s very sanguine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>On the whole, he was relieved when Jake left, because
he found it an effort to talk, but the thoughts
he afterwards indulged in were gloomy. His broken
ribs did not trouble him much, but there was some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
risk of his losing his eye. He had helped to expose
and banish Kenwardine, and could not ask Clare to
marry him after that, even if he were not half blind
and disfigured. Besides, it was doubtful if he would
be able to resume his profession or do any useful work
again. The sight of the uninjured eye might go. As
a matter of fact, the strain he had borne for some
time had told upon his health and the shock of the
accident had made things worse. He had sunk into
a dejected, lethargic mood, from which he had not
the vigor to rouse himself.
</p>
<p>A week later he was helped on board a small French
boat and sailed for Santa Brigida. He did not improve
with the sea air, as Jake had hoped, and for the
most part avoided the few passengers and sat alone in
the darkest corner he could find. Now and then he
moodily read Kenwardine&#8217;s letters. He had at first
expected much from them. They might have removed
the stain upon his name and the greatest obstacle between
himself and Clare; but he no longer cared much
about the former and the letters were useless now.
For all that, he put them carefully away in a leather
case which he carried in an inside pocket.

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<h3>IDA INTERFERES</h3>
</div>

<p>On his return to Santa Brigida, Dick went to see
a Spanish oculist, who took a more hopeful view
than the Kingston doctor, although he admitted that
there was some danger of the injury proving permanent.
Dick felt slightly comforted when he learned
that the oculist was a clever man who had been well
known in Barcelona until he was forced to leave the
city after taking part in some revolutionary plot. He
was, however, unable to resume his work, and while
he brooded over his misfortunes a touch of the malaria
he had already suffered from hindered his recovery.
One of the effects of malaria is a feeling of
black depression. He was feebly struggling against the
weakness and despondence when Fuller arrived and
soon afterwards came to see him. Dick, who was sitting
in the darkest corner of the veranda, had got
rid of his bandage; but an ugly, livid mark crossed his
forehead to the shade above his eyes and his face
looked worn. Fuller talked about the dam for a time,
and then stopped and looked hard at his silent companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I imagined all this would interest you, but you
don&#8217;t say much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;You see, it&#8217;s galling to listen
to plans you can&#8217;t take part in. In fact, I feel I
ought to resign.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks as if it may be a long time before I can
get to work and I may never be of much use again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose it&#8217;s natural that you should feel
badly humped, but you don&#8217;t know that you&#8217;ll lose
your eye, and if you did, you&#8217;d do your work all right
with the other. However, since you started the subject,
I&#8217;ve something to say about our contract. If
the new scheme we&#8217;re negotiating goes through, as I
think it will, I&#8217;ll have to increase my staff. Should
I do so, you&#8217;ll get a move up and, of course, better
pay for a more important job.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick, who was touched by this mark of confidence,
thanked him awkwardly, and although he felt bound
to object that he might be unable to fill the new post,
Fuller stopped him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All you have to do is to lie off and take it easy
until you get well. I know a useful man when I see
him and it won&#8217;t pay me to let you go. When I&#8217;ve
fixed things with the President I&#8217;ll make you an offer.
Now Stuyvesant&#8217;s waiting for me and I understand
my daughter is coming to see you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went away and soon afterwards Ida Fuller came
in. Dick rather awkwardly got her a chair, for his
shade, which was closely pulled down, embarrassed
him, but she noticed this, and his clumsiness made a
strong appeal. She liked Dick and had some ground
for being grateful to him. For half an hour she
talked in a cheerful strain and Dick did his best to
respond, but she saw what the effort cost and went
away in a thoughtful mood.
</p>
<p>Ida Fuller had both sympathy and self-confidence,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
and when things went wrong with her friends seldom
felt diffident about trying to put them right. In consequence,
she took Jake away from the others, whom
her father had asked to dinner that evening.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with Dick Brandon?&#8221; she
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty obvious. His trouble began with
broken ribs and may end with the loss of his eye; but
if you want a list of his symptoms&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Ida. &#8220;Does his trouble end with
the injury to his eye?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake gave her a sharp glance. &#8220;If you insist on
knowing, I admit that I have my doubts. But you
must remember that Dick has a touch of malaria,
which makes one morbid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But this doesn&#8217;t account for everything?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jake, who lighted a cigarette, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
think it does. In fact, as I know your capabilities
and begin to see what you&#8217;re getting after, there&#8217;s not
much use in my trying to put you off the track.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ida sat down in a canvas chair and pondered for
a minute or two.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know Miss Kenwardine; if I recollect, you
were rather enthusiastic about her. What is she
like?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake&#8217;s eyes twinkled. &#8220;You mean&mdash;is she good
enough for Dick? He&#8217;ll be a lucky man if he gets
her, and I don&#8217;t mind confessing that I thought of
marrying her myself only she made it clear that she
had no use for me. She was quite right; I&#8217;d have
made a very poor match for a girl like that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ida was not deceived by his half-humorous manner,
for she remarked something that it was meant to hide.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
Still, Jake had had numerous love affairs that seldom
lasted long.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you been to see her since you came back?&#8221;
she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jake. &#8220;After helping to drive her
father out of the country, I knew it would be an awkward
meeting, but I felt I ought to go because she
might be in difficulties, and I went twice. On the
whole, it was a relief when I was told she was not at
home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder whether she would see me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re pretty smart, but I suspect this is too delicate
a matter for you to meddle with.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be better able to judge if you tell me what you
know about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake did so with some hesitation. He knew his
sister&#8217;s talents and that her object was good, but he
shrank from betraying his comrade&#8217;s secrets.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ve put you wise, but I feel rather mean,&#8221;
he concluded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What you feel is not important. But you really
think he hasn&#8217;t sent her Kenwardine&#8217;s letter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jake made a sign of agreement and Ida resumed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;The other letter stating that his cousin stole the
plans is equally valuable and his making no use of it
is significant. Your partner&#8217;s a white man, Jake, but
he&#8217;s foolish and needs the help of a judicious friend.
I want both letters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve warned you that it&#8217;s a dangerous game. You
may muss up things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll be responsible. Can you get the letters?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; Jake replied with an embarrassed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
grin. &#8220;In a way, it&#8217;s a shabby trick, but if he will
keep papers in his pocket after getting one lot stolen,
he must take the consequences.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Ida calmly. &#8220;Now we had better
go in before the others wonder why we left them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Next morning Clare sat in the patio in very low
spirits. No word had come from Kenwardine, and
her money was nearly exhausted. She had heard of
Dick&#8217;s return, but not that he was injured, and he had
kept away. This was not surprising and she did not
want to meet him; but it was strange that he had not
come to see her and make some excuse for what he
had done. He could, of course, make none that would
appease her, but he ought to have tried, and it looked
as if he did not care what she thought of his treachery.
</p>
<p>Then she glanced up as Ida came in. Clare had
seen Ida in the street and knew who she was, but she
studied her with keen curiosity as she advanced. Her
dress was tasteful, she was pretty, and had a certain
stamp of refinement and composure that Clare knew
came from social training; but she felt antagonistic.
For all that, she indicated a chair and waited until her
visitor sat down. Then she asked with a level glance:
&#8220;Why have you come to see me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect you mean&mdash;why did I come without getting
your servant to announce me?&#8221; Ida rejoined with
a disarming smile. &#8220;Well, the gate was open, and
I wanted to see you very much, but was half afraid
you wouldn&#8217;t let me in. I owe you some apology, but
understand that my brother is a friend of yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was,&#8221; Clare said coldly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he has lost your friendship by taking Dick
Brandon&#8217;s part?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span></p>
<p>Clare colored, but her voice was firm as she answered:
</p>
<p>&#8220;To some extent that is true. Mr. Brandon has
cruelly injured us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was forced. Dick Brandon is not the man
to shirk his duty because it was painful and clashed
with his wishes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it his duty to ruin my father?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He must have thought so; but we are getting on
dangerous ground. I don&#8217;t know much about the
matter. Do you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare lowered her eyes. Since Richter&#8217;s visit, she
had had disturbing doubts about the nature of Kenwardine&#8217;s
business; but after a few moments she asked
in a hard, suspicious voice: &#8220;How do you know so
much about Mr. Brandon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Ida calmly, &#8220;it&#8217;s plain that I&#8217;m not
in love with him, because if I were, I should not have
tried to make his peace with you. As a matter of
fact, I&#8217;m going to marry somebody else before very
long. However, now I think I&#8217;ve cleared away a possible
mistake, I&#8217;ll own that I like Dick Brandon very
much and am grateful to him for the care he has
taken of my brother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He stopped Jake from coming here,&#8221; Clare rejoined
with a blush.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is so,&#8221; Ida agreed. &#8220;He has done a number
of other things that got him into difficulties, because
he thought it right. That&#8217;s the kind of man he
is. Then I understand he was out of work and feeling
desperate when my father engaged him, he got
promotion in his employment, and I asked him to see
that Jake came to no harm. I don&#8217;t know if he kept
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
his promise too conscientiously, and you can judge
better than me. But I think you ought to read the
letters your father gave him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She first put down Kenwardine&#8217;s statement about
the theft of the plans, and Clare was conscious of
overwhelming relief as she read it. Dick knew now
that she was not the thief. Then Ida said: &#8220;If you
will read the next, you will see that your father doesn&#8217;t
feel much of a grievance against Brandon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The note was short, but Kenwardine stated clearly
that if Clare wished to marry Brandon he would be
satisfied and advised her to do so. The girl&#8217;s face
flushed as she read and her hands trembled. Kenwardine
certainly seemed to bear Dick no ill will.
But since the latter had his formal consent, why had
he not used it?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Mr. Brandon send you with these letters?&#8221;
she asked as calmly as she could.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I brought them without telling him, because
it seemed the best thing to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You knew what they said?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; Ida admitted. &#8220;They were open.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare noted her confession; but she must deal with
matters of much greater importance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then do you know why he kept the letters back?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ida hesitated. If Clare were not the girl she
thought, she might, by appealing to her compassion,
supply her with a reason for giving Dick up, but if
this happened, it would be to his advantage in the
end. Still she did not think she was mistaken and
she must take the risk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I feel that you ought to understand
his reasons; that is really why I came. It looks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
as if you had not heard that shortly after he met your
father Dick fell down the steamer&#8217;s hold.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare made an abrupt movement and her face got
anxious. &#8220;Was he hurt?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very badly. He broke two ribs and the fever
he got soon afterwards stopped his getting better; but
that is not the worst. One of his eyes was injured,
and there is some danger that he may lose his sight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was plain that Clare had got a shock, for she sat
in a tense attitude and the color left her face; but Ida
saw that she had read her character right and taken
the proper course. Indeed, she wondered whether
she had not unnecessarily harrowed the girl&#8217;s feelings.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she resumed, &#8220;you understand why Dick
Brandon kept back the letters. It is obvious that he
loves you, but he is disfigured and may have to give
up his profession&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>She stopped, for Clare&#8217;s face changed and her eyes
shone with a gentle light.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what does that matter?&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;He can&#8217;t think it would daunt me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ida rose, for she saw that she had said enough.
&#8220;Then perhaps you had better show him that you are
not afraid. If you will dine with us this evening at
the dam, you will see him. Jake will come for you
and bring you back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When she left a few minutes later she had arranged
for the visit, and Clare sat still, overwhelmed with
compassionate gentleness and relief. Her father did
not blame Dick and there was no reason she should
harden her heart against him. He knew that she was
innocent, but he was tied by honorable scruples.
Well, since he would not come to her, she must go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
to him, but she would do so with pride and not false
shame. It was clear that he loved her unselfishly.
By and by, however, she roused herself. As she was
going to him, there were matters to think about, and
entering the house she spent some time studying her
wardrobe and wondering what she would wear.
</p>
<p>That evening Dick sat on the veranda of his shack,
with a shaded lamp, which he had turned low, on the
table close by. His comrades were dining at Fuller&#8217;s
tent and he had been asked, but had made excuses although
he was well enough to go. For one thing, it
hurt him to sit in a strong light, though the oculist,
whom he had seen in the morning, spoke encouragingly
about his eye. Indeed, Dick had begun to think
that there was now no real danger of its having received
a permanent injury. For all that, he was listless
and depressed, because he had not got rid of the
fever and malaria is generally worse at night. He
had been cautioned not to read and his cigarette had
a bitter taste. There was nothing to do but wait until
Jake came home. Now he thought of it, Jake had accepted
his excuses rather easily.
</p>
<p>By and by, he heard the lad&#8217;s voice and footsteps
on the path. Jake was returning early and there was
somebody with him, but Dick wished they had left
him alone. He rose, however, as Ida came up the
steps and into the light, which did not carry far. Dick
imagined there was another person as well as Jake
in the shadow behind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jake brought me over to see his last sketches and
I&#8217;m going in to criticize them,&#8221; she said. &#8220;As you
couldn&#8217;t come to us, I&#8217;ve brought you a visitor, whom
you know.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span></p>
<p>Dick felt his heart beat as he saw Clare. She was
dressed in white, and the silver clasp gleamed against
a lavender band at her waist. It was significant that
she wore it, but he could not see her face clearly.
Then Ida beckoned Jake.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along; I want to look at the drawings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They went into the house, and Dick made an effort
to preserve his self-control. Clare moved into the
light and he saw her color rise, though her eyes were
very soft.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me you were ill?&#8221; she asked
with gentle reproach.
</p>
<p>He hesitated, trying to strengthen his resolution,
which he knew was breaking down, and Clare resumed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides, I don&#8217;t think you should have kept that
letter back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick instinctively pulled out the leather case, and
started as he saw there was nothing inside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gone. You have seen it?&#8221; he stammered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen them both,&#8221; Clare answered with a smile.
&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t this remind you of something? I&#8217;m afraid
you&#8217;re careless, Dick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The color rushed into his face. &#8220;If you have seen
those letters, you know what a suspicious fool I&#8217;ve
been.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t matter. You&#8217;re convinced at last?&#8221;
Clare rejoined with a hint of pride.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a sense, I always was convinced. If I&#8217;d seen
you take the wretched plans, I wouldn&#8217;t have held you
accountable. Because you took them, it couldn&#8217;t have
been wrong.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare blushed, but looked at him with shining eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
&#8220;I wanted to hear you say it again. But it wasn&#8217;t
that letter&mdash;I mean the one about the plans&mdash;that
brought me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the last of Dick&#8217;s self-control vanished and
with a half conscious movement he held out his hands.
Clare came forward and next moment she was in his
arms.
</p>
<p>Some time later he felt he must be practical and
said in a deprecatory tone: &#8220;But you must try to
understand what you are doing, dear, and the sacrifices
you must make. Things aren&#8217;t quite as bad as
they looked, but I can&#8217;t go home just yet and may
always be a poor engineer.&#8221; He indicated the galvanized-iron
shack. &#8220;You will have to live in a place
like this, and though I think my eye will get better,
there&#8217;s the scar on my face&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clare gave him a quiet smiling glance. &#8220;That
doesn&#8217;t matter, Dick, and I never really had a home.&#8221;
She paused and added gently: &#8220;But I shall have one
now.&#8221;
